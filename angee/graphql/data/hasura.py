class HasuraLines:
    """A declared editable child-lines relation for a document resource (F6).

    A resource passes ``lines=HasuraLines(field="lines", model=OrderLine)`` to
    :func:`hasura_model_resource` to gain (a) Hasura-native nested inserts
    (``insert_<res>_one(object: {..., lines: {data: [...]}})``, riding the
    ``strawberry-django-hasura`` nested-insert shape) and (b) an authored
    ``<res>_save(pk, patch, lines)`` mutation that diff-applies children
    (create/update/delete by public id) and patches the parent in one
    transaction, REBAC-checked on the parent (children ride the §3.4 elevation
    after that preflight).

    ``field`` is the parent's reverse-FK accessor to the child rows; the child's
    FK back to the parent is derived from it and set by the write, never asked
    for on the wire. ``writable`` overrides the child's editable-column allowlist;
    ``public_id_fields`` names the child relation columns exposed as public ids
    (decoded on write). ``node`` is the child GraphQL node, used only to name the
    child field metadata the frontend line cells render. ``position_field`` names
    the integer order column (advertised so the composer maintains it).

    Completeness contract: ``<res>_save(lines=…)`` takes the **full desired child
    set** — deletion is by omission, so an id absent from the set is deleted. The
    caller must therefore send back every stored line (each kept row carrying its
    public id); a partial read that omits stored lines would ask to delete them.
    The write enforces the enforceable half of this contract server-side: every
    public id the caller sends must address a currently stored line of this parent
    (a stale, foreign, or truncated baseline is rejected wholesale with a
    ``ValidationError`` rather than silently mis-applied). The full desired set is
    resolved under a parent-row lock so concurrent saves cannot cross-delete each
    other's lines.
