"""Rebac-aware override of Django's ``createsuperuser``.

Like :mod:`~angee.base.management.commands.changepassword`, the stock command
reaches the User model through ``User._default_manager`` with no actor bound —
both the uniqueness check (``get_by_natural_key``) and the final
``create_superuser`` call. Under Angee's rebac-scoped User manager with
``REBAC_STRICT_MODE=True`` that raises :class:`rebac.errors.MissingActorError`.

Every DB access in the stock command happens inside ``handle()`` (the interactive
prompt loop and the non-interactive path both validate and create there), so
wrapping ``handle()`` in ``system_context`` is sufficient. Placed in
``angee.base`` for the same INSTALLED_APPS ordering reason as ``changepassword``:
it loads before ``django.contrib.auth``, which Django's command discovery
requires for a same-named override to win.

Note: Angee's first-class superuser path is ``angee.iam.bootstrap_admin`` (env/
settings-driven, idempotent, also grants the platform-admin role). This override
just keeps the stock ``createsuperuser`` usable for ad-hoc/interactive creation.
