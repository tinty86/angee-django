"""Rebac-aware override of Django's ``changepassword``.

The stock command loads the target user through ``User._default_manager``
with no actor bound (``django/contrib/auth/management/commands/changepassword``).
Under Angee's rebac-scoped User manager with ``REBAC_STRICT_MODE=True`` that
materialisation raises :class:`rebac.errors.MissingActorError`, so the vanilla
command cannot run.

This override lives in ``angee.base`` — which loads before ``django.contrib.auth``
in ``INSTALLED_APPS``, the ordering Django's command discovery requires for a
same-named command to win — and runs the whole operation inside
``system_context``: the same audited bypass the framework already uses for
out-of-request maintenance jobs (see ``angee.iam.bootstrap_admin``). Behaviour
is otherwise identical to the stock command (prompting, validation, retries).
