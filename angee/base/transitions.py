"""Guarded transition methods for ``StateField`` columns.

API contract:

``StateTransitions(field, graph, policy_setting=None)`` opts one ``StateField``
into guarding and binds it to the declared source-to-target graph. Graph keys are
source values or source lists; graph values are target values or target lists.
Values are normalized through the field, so callers may use enum members, stored
values, or the enum member names the field accepts.

``policy_setting`` names a composed Django settings key holding a policy overlay
``{"allow": [[source, target], ...], "deny": [[source, target], ...]}`` whose edge
values are enum values (strings). The overlay is merged over the declared graph
when a transition runs — ``allow`` adds edges, ``deny`` removes them, deny winning
over allow — so a deployment enables or disables specific edges through composed
settings (autoconfig defaults overridden by the project ``settings.yaml``) with no
code change. Reading the overlay at call time is what lets composed settings and
test overrides take effect. A per-company resolution seam (resolving the overlay
through the instance's company) is reserved but not built.

``@transition(field, source=..., target=..., conditions=[...], on_success=...,
policy=...)`` decorates the model's own transition methods. ``source`` is a single
value or a list of values. Conditions are pure ``condition(instance)`` callables;
a false condition raises ``TransitionNotAllowed`` and the method body does not run.
``on_success`` is an explicit ``hook(instance, source, target)`` callback; there is
no signal dispatch. ``policy`` marks a transition whose edge is governed by the
declaration's ``policy_setting``: such an edge need not appear in the declared
graph (it may be default-disabled), so class construction does not require it, and
calling the method while the policy leaves the edge disabled raises
``TransitionNotAllowed``. A policy-enabled edge still runs the declared guards and
conditions. There is no transition-driven verb/surface registry today (transitions
are surfaced by hand-authored mutations), so the marker carries the edge's policy
name for a future surface to exclude a disabled verb; the guard behavior is what
ships now.

The decorated method body runs after the source/graph/condition checks and before
the target write. The primitive owns the state write and then calls
``on_success``. It does not save the model; transition methods remain ordinary
model methods and own any persistence of non-state fields. Illegal transitions
raise ``TransitionNotAllowed`` with the field, source, and target in the message.

Direct Python assignment to a guarded field is rejected at descriptor level after
initial model construction. The descriptor still permits initial loading,
idempotent field normalization, and the primitive's own target write, so existing
``StateField`` users are untouched unless they declare ``StateTransitions``.
