# ghcr.io/ang-ee/django-angee-base — the framework runtime base image.
#
# Lean and direct on python-slim + uv (no intermediate "docker-django" base): the
# framework's dependency closure is baked into a venv OUTSIDE the app root
# (`/opt/.venv`), so a project's source can bind-mount over `/app` in dev while the
# baked deps survive — change code, it's live; change a lockfile, `up --build`
# rebuilds the deps layer. The framework CODE is NOT baked here: it is mounted
# (framework dev) or added by a derived image / installed as the wheel (downstream
# project). Two targets share these stages: `final` is the deps-only base image
# (`django-angee-base`, the container analogue of the `django-angee` wheel's deps);
# the `runtime` target below is the derived image this comment foretells — it bakes
# the framework code + `[postgres]` into `ghcr.io/ang-ee/django-angee`, the fuller
# image the self-contained `local` stack runs.
