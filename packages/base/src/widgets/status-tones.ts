/**
 * The shared status vocabulary: which status-string values render in which tone. One
 * owner for "what color is this status", consumed by every status display — the
 * `statusBadge` pill, the `colorDot` dot, and the operator console's `StateTag` — so
 * they cannot drift (each previously kept its own divergent private map).
 *
 * It lives at the widget layer, never in `lib/tones.ts` (which stays domain-free): the
 * color *mechanism* is a framework fact, the status *vocabulary* a product one. A caller
 * overrides any value with an explicit `<Column tone={{ VALUE: "tone" }}>` map (which
 * wins); spread `STATUS_TONES` to extend rather than replace it. An unmapped value falls
 * to `brand` — the deliberate "unknown status" tone.
 *
 * Tones read as: success = live/healthy/done · warning = in-flight/needs-attention ·
 * danger = failed/hard-down · neutral = dormant/inert. The run-state axis the colored
 * dot shows maps stopped→neutral (grey), running→success (green), error→danger (red),
 * warning→warning (amber); see `docs/frontend/guidelines.md`.
