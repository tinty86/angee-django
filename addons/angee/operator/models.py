"""Source models for the operator addon.

The operator daemon owns all real state; this addon adds no table. Its two
sources are table-less REBAC type anchors that exist only so synthetic resources
gated by a const-backed ``admin`` relation in ``permissions.zed`` resolve to a
model for the REBAC system check (``rebac.E009``): ``OperatorConnection`` anchors
``operator/connection`` (the singleton daemon connection) and ``OperatorRole``
anchors the ``operator/role`` namespace (so a platform admin resolves as an
effective operator-admin through its const). ``managed = False``: Django owns no
table and emits no table operations, there are no rows, and the forward access
check synthesises the admin subject from the schema — so these models are never
read or written. They are type anchors, nothing more.
