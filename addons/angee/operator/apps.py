    schema that gates it, plus the ``OperatorDaemon`` server-side bridge Django
    uses to drive the daemon over its REST API — e.g. provisioning an agent on a
    user's behalf. The daemon still owns all stack/service/source/workspace
    lifecycle; this addon only reaches it (from the browser, or from Django).
