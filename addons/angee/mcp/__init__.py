"""MCP server — the generic seam that mounts one FastMCP server for the process.

Mounts a single StreamableHTTP ASGI app at ``/mcp`` (via the ``http_mounts``
seam in :mod:`angee.mcp.asgi`, which :mod:`angee.asgi` discovers and gives a
lifespan), authenticates the bearer to a REBAC actor with a FastMCP token
verifier, and authorizes each tool with rebac. Owns no MCP catalogue and no tools
of its own: an addon declares ``mcp_tools`` in its ``addon.toml`` ``[contributes]``
to contribute tools, and the catalogue owner supplies the bearer→actor verifier through
``ANGEE_MCP_ACTOR_VERIFIER``.
