"""Money: the currency catalogue, dated rates, and conversion.

A :class:`Currency` is one ISO-4217 currency in a shared catalogue; a
:class:`CurrencyRate` is one dated exchange rate for a currency expressed as
*units of that currency per one reference unit*. The reference is
``ANGEE_MONEY_REFERENCE_CURRENCY`` — a **required project setting with no shipped
default**: money bakes in no fiscal constant (a currency, country, or locale is a
project fact, never a framework one), so a USD default was deliberately rejected
in review. :func:`reference_currency_code` fails fast with
:class:`~django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` naming the setting when it
is unset, and the addon's system check (``apps.py``) surfaces the same at
``manage.py check`` time.

Rounding vocabulary lives here too. :meth:`Currency.round` wraps
:func:`angee.base.numeric.quantize` to the currency's exponent and resolves the
mode from :class:`angee.money.rounding.RoundingMode`, defaulting to ``half_up``
unless a caller explicitly overrides it. :meth:`Currency.convert` crosses through
the reference currency and returns the amount **unrounded** — the consumer rounds
the converted amount at the point that owns the business policy.
