"""Messaging addon: threads, messages, and the channel-bridge substrate.

Built on the parties contacts foundation — a message's sender and participants
are ``parties.Handle`` rows — so the dependency points one way (messaging →
parties). Channels are ``integrate.Integration`` children (bridges) that ingest
messages from email/social sources.
