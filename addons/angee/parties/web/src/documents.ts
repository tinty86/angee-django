// Bespoke console operation for connecting a CardDAV directory — a single action
// that creates the Basic-auth credential + the Directory (two models), the
// sanctioned multi-model-create shape. The directories list/detail are model-driven
// (ResourceList reads the SDL) and sync is the single-id `sync_integration` action, so
// neither needs a document here.
