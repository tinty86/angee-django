// Turn a caught ACP/transport failure into a message fit for the user.

/**
 * The human message of a caught value, else `fallback`.
 *
 * A failed ACP request rejects with the raw JSON-RPC error object
 * (`{ code, message, data }`), *not* an `Error`: the connection does
 * `reject(response.error)` (see @zed-industries/agent-client-protocol
 * `#handleResponse`). So an agent-side failure — e.g. a 401 from its model API —
 * carries its detail on that object's `message`, which must be read off the
 * object shape too, not just `Error.message`, or it is dropped for the fallback
 * and the user only sees "did not respond" with the real cause hidden in logs.
