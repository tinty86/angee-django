"""Shared SSRF-pinned outbound HTTP for integration backends.

The single owner of "make one outbound HTTP request." The transport is httpx over
a custom httpcore network backend (:class:`_PinnedBackend`) that resolves the host
once and dials a validated IP — closing the resolve-then-connect (DNS-rebind) gap
— while httpcore's ``start_tls(server_hostname=…)`` keeps TLS verification on the
original hostname. The address judgement is owned by ``net.is_unsafe_address``;
this module only pins and dials.

One outbound-network policy lives here and everything composes it: integration
backends reach it as ``self.http`` (:class:`HttpClientMixin`), and the OAuth client
hands the same :class:`PinnedTransport` to Authlib. TLS trusts the system store
(``ssl.create_default_context``) per docs/backend/guidelines.md, not httpx's bundled
certifi default.

By default only public addresses are dialled. ``allow_private=True`` is the
operator-configured-connection policy — a self-hosted host on a private network:
it permits RFC-1918 / loopback so those connections work, but still rejects the
SSRF escapes that have no legitimate target either way — cloud metadata (the
well-known IPs, link-local ``169.254/16``, and the RFC 6598 shared range that
front metadata services), multicast, and unspecified. Redirects are not followed
unless ``follow_redirects=True``; each hop re-enters the pinned backend, so
following stays safe.
