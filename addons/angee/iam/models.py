"""Source models for Angee identity.

Pure identity: the swappable ``User`` and its manager, plus the ``Company`` of
record — the operating entity acting *inside* the system, an access-control
scope with a REBAC hierarchy. The OAuth connection substrate
(``OAuthClient``/``ExternalAccount``/``Credential``) is owned by ``integrate``;
OIDC login fields are contributed onto that OAuth client by
``iam_integrate_oidc``.

Company scope convention
------------------------
Two "company" concepts must never be conflated. An *external* company (a
customer, vendor, any counterparty — a description of the outside world) is a
``parties.Organization``, never modelled here. The *company of record* — the
entity that acts inside the system — is this ``iam.Company``: an access-control
scope, so it belongs to ``iam`` (the lowest addon in the dependency order) and
carries no fiscal fields and no party FK. Its public face (a link to a
``parties.Party`` for name/addresses/logo) is a same-row ``extends`` merge owned
by ``angee.parties``; its fiscal face (currency, counterpart accounts, rounding
policy) is a same-row ``extends`` merge owned by ``arp.accounting`` — both
downstream, so the dependency stays one-way.

Every model whose rows belong to a company of record composes
:class:`CompanyScopedMixin` (the ``company`` FK) and adds the matching arm to its
own ``permissions.zed`` definition, so isolation is enforced from day one::

    definition <app>/<model> {
        relation company: iam/company // rebac:field=company
        relation admin:   angee/role   // rebac:const=admin

        permission read   = company->member + admin->member
        permission write  = company->member + admin->member
        permission delete = company->member + admin->member
    }

Company-scoped role bindings are relations *on the company* (``accountant``,
``salesperson``), so a scoped resource reads ``company->accountant`` — an
accountant *of company A*, never a global accountant. Subsidiaries inherit reach
through ``parent`` (``permission member = direct_member + parent->member``): an
ancestor-company member reaches every descendant scope.
