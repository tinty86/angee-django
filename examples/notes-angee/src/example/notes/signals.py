"""Ownership relationships for notes, derived from the acting user.

Creating a note grants the creator the ``owner`` relation on ``notes/note``;
deleting a note clears its relationships. Owner grants are what make a note
readable and writable by its creator under the permission schema, so they are
wired to the model lifecycle rather than left to callers. The creator/updater
audit ids are stamped by the framework ``AuditMixin`` handler, not here.
