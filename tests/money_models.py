"""Concrete stand-in models for ``MoneyField`` tests.

The framework core ships ``MoneyField`` but not the ``angee.money`` addon (that
incubates in arpee), so these bare models stand in for the currency addon: a
``Currency`` under app label ``money`` — the ``"money.Currency"`` label
``MoneyField.check`` resolves against — plus documents carrying a ``MoneyField``
in both currency-path shapes (a sibling FK and a one-hop related path). They are
plain models under an app that is not installed: nothing migrates them and no
row is ever created, so they serve field ``check``/``deconstruct``/metadata
introspection without a database table.
