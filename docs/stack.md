# Opinionated Stack

This file is the source of truth for the libraries Angee binds and what each one
owns. The stack is opinionated so product and addon work starts from settled
choices instead of re-litigating infrastructure. If a concern is listed here,
use the library's native shape and keep Angee as thin glue.

Dependency changes must update this file in the same change.

## How The Stack Is Locked

- `docs/stack.md` owns concern boundaries: which library owns which job, and
  what thin glue Angee adds.
- `pyproject.toml` owns Python package metadata, workspace membership, tool
  configuration, and declared Python dependencies. `uv.lock` pins the resolved
  Python graph. Use `uv add` / `uv lock`; do not use `pip install` by hand.
- `package.json` owns JavaScript package scripts and declared dependencies.
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` owns workspace membership. `pnpm-lock.yaml` pins the
  resolved JavaScript graph. Use `pnpm add` / `pnpm install`; do not use npm or
  yarn.
- A dependency change is complete only when the concern row here and the
  relevant manifest or lockfile agree.

## Backend

| Pick | Owns | Angee adds |
|---|---|---|
| Python >= 3.14 | Runtime and typing | Project conventions |
| Django 6.0+ | ORM, migrations, admin, auth contract, app registry | Abstract bases and build-time composition into runtime apps |

## Rendered Binding

`@angee/sdk` stays headless. `@angee/base` is the single rendered binding.

| Pick | Owns | Angee adds |
|---|---|---|
| @base-ui/react | Headless primitives: dialog, popover, menu, tabs, tooltip, field, toolbar, scroll area, and related UI | Styled binding and composition rules; controlled `open`/`onOpenChange` owns popover/dialog transition timing |

## Change Policy

- Add a dependency only with an owner row here.
- Remove a dependency by deleting its row.
- Swap a dependency by updating the row and explaining why in the change.
- Move proposed picks into a locked section before shipping code that depends on
  them.
