# Opinionated Stack

This file is the source of truth for the libraries Angee binds and what each one
owns. The stack is opinionated so product and addon work starts from settled
choices instead of re-litigating infrastructure. If a concern is listed here,
use the library's native shape and keep Angee as thin glue.

Dependency changes must update this file in the same change.

## How The Stack Is Locked

- `docs/stack.md` owns concern boundaries: which library owns which job, and
  what thin glue Angee adds.
- `pyproject.toml` owns Python package metadata, workspace membership, tool
  configuration, and declared Python dependencies. `uv.lock` pins the resolved
  Python graph. Use `uv add` / `uv lock`; do not use `pip install` by hand.
- `package.json` owns JavaScript package scripts and declared dependencies.
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` owns workspace membership. `pnpm-lock.yaml` pins the
  resolved JavaScript graph. Use `pnpm add` / `pnpm install`; do not use npm or
  yarn.
- A dependency change is complete only when the concern row here and the
  relevant manifest or lockfile agree.

## Backend

| Pick | Owns | Angee adds |
|---|---|---|
| Python >= 3.14 | Runtime and typing | Project conventions |
| Django 6.0+ | ORM, migrations, admin, auth contract, app registry | Abstract bases and build-time composition into runtime apps |
| strawberry-django | GraphQL types, resolvers, dataloaders, schema printing | Merge addon schema parts into named schemas, `crud`/`changes` shortcuts, emit SDL, serve per name |
| django-choices-field | Enum-backed model fields | `StateField` semantic wrapper |
| strawberry-django-aggregates | Aggregation and group-by resolvers | Addon-level `AggregateBuilder` wiring (per addon, e.g. notes) |
| strawberry-django-hasura | Expose Django models in the Hasura GraphQL dialect (`_bool_exp`/`_aggregate`/`x_by_pk`/`_set`), plus computed (non-model) sources via a `run_query` `RowSource` | Composes it as the model emitter (`hasura_model_resource`) and the pydantic computed-source emitter (`hasura_pydantic_resource`) |
| pydantic | Typed model validation/parsing | Row-shape SSOT for computed (non-model) Hasura resources — the node + filter scalars derive from the pydantic model (`hasura_pydantic_resource`) |
| channels + uvicorn | ASGI/WebSocket transport and serving | GraphQL subscription mounting; uvicorn serves the composed ASGI app and sends the lifespan that enters the MCP mount's `http_app` lifespan (`angee.asgi`) |
| django-zed-rebac | REBAC engine, actor scoping, relationship storage, local and SpiceDB-compatible backends | Per-addon schema merge, reserved roles, actor resolver |
| django-sqids | Opaque external IDs | `SqidMixin`, `SqidField` (NULL-safe decode on joins), GraphQL boundary scalar |
| django-simple-history | Shadow history tables and revert | `HistoryMixin` marker |
| django-reversion | Versioned field snapshots and revert | `RevisionMixin` convenience API, composer-emitted model registration |
| cryptography | Encryption primitives | `EncryptedField` (Fernet at rest, secret-by-type) |
| django-import-export + tablib | Resource import/export resources, tabular formats, row cleaning, and row results | Tiered manifests, xref ledger, and frozen-tier policy |
| pyyaml | YAML parsing substrate | Resource loader reads `.yaml`/`.yml` resource files; django-yamlconf consumes project settings YAML |
| ruamel.yaml | Comment/format-preserving round-trip YAML editing | The `AddonInstaller`'s `settings.yaml` `INSTALLED_APPS` install/uninstall edit — the one writer that must preserve operator comments and layout (pyyaml round-trips lose them); not used at boot |
| django-yamlconf | Django settings YAML overlays | `angee.compose.settings` loads `settings.yaml` beside `manage.py`; `Composer` applies addon `autoconfig.py` fragments |
| django-environ | Typed boot environment access and URL parsers | `angee.compose.settings` reads Angee bootstrap env vars |
| pyjwt[crypto] | JWT/JOSE signature + claims verification and JWKS fetch | OIDC id_token verification (`OAuthClientOidcProtocol.verify_id_token`); kept because `authlib.jose` is deprecated. The OAuth2 token exchange itself is owned by authlib |
| authlib | OAuth2/OIDC client protocol — authorization-code + refresh-token requests, client authentication, PKCE (RFC 7636), and token revocation (RFC 7009) | Thin per-`OAuthClient` `OAuth2Client` adapter behind the stable `OAuthClientProtocol` seam, plus the non-standard JSON-token-body shim; id_token verification stays on pyjwt |
| httpx | HTTP client/transport for all integrate outbound calls | `integrate.http.PinnedTransport` — an SSRF-pinned httpx transport that resolves once and dials a validated IP (judgement owned by `integrate.net.is_unsafe_address`) with system-store TLS. Composed by `HttpClient` (the integration backends) and by the OAuth client (handed to authlib's `OAuth2Client`); the honest `Angee-Integrate/1.0` UA and an injected transport test seam ride on it |
| httpcore | httpx's low-level connection pool + network backend | `integrate.http._PinnedBackend` subclasses `httpcore.SyncBackend` and overrides `connect_tcp` to dial the validated IP; `PinnedTransport` swaps it into the pool's `_network_backend`. Named and bounded directly because the SSRF pin owns httpcore's `SyncBackend`/`ConnectionPool` API, not just via httpx |
| mcp (jlowin FastMCP v2) | MCP server — tool registration, JSON-RPC, StreamableHTTP ASGI app, bearer auth (`TokenVerifier`), per-call middleware | Mounts one StreamableHTTP app at `/mcp` via the `asgi.py` `http_mounts` seam (its `http_app` lifespan entered by `angee.asgi` via `router.lifespan_context`), authenticates the bearer to a REBAC actor with a `fastmcp.server.auth.TokenVerifier` and brackets each tool call in that actor; addon tools — incl. `GraphQLTool` operations executed under the actor (`angee.mcp.graphql`) — run scoped, and rebac authorizes |
| anthropic | Anthropic Claude API SDK — Messages API client, model catalogue, retries, typed SDK models | `agents_integrate_anthropic` maps Angee inference providers/models to the SDK and contributes the backend into `ANGEE_INFERENCE_BACKEND_CLASSES` |
| openai | OpenAI Python SDK — Chat Completions client, model catalogue, retries, typed SDK models | `agents_integrate_openai` maps Angee inference providers/models to the SDK and contributes the backend into `ANGEE_INFERENCE_BACKEND_CLASSES` |
| python-magic | MIME detection from file bytes | Storage finalize detection (requires the system libmagic) |
| vobject | vCard/iCalendar parse + serialise | `parties_integrate_carddav` parses CardDAV vCards into parties/handles/addresses (and serialises for round-trip) |
| markdown-it-py | CommonMark tokenizer with source line spans (block token `.map`) | `knowledge` slices doc sections by heading without re-rendering — the `MarkdownPage` structure methods (`parse_outline`/`outline`, `section_range`, `spliced_section`, `spliced_unique`) shared by the `outline` read field and the section-anchored patch write |
| uv | Python dependency resolution and workspaces | Workspace layout |

## Frontend

| Pick | Owns | Angee adds |
|---|---|---|
| React 19 | View library | Component conventions |
| TypeScript >= 6 | Language and type system | Branded boundary types |
| @refinedev/core | Resource registry, standard data hooks, react-query cache/invalidation, auth/i18n/live provider contracts | Angee projects emitted `angee.resources` metadata to refine resources and mounts one composed `<Refine>` root with named providers and the TanStack Router binding |
| @refinedev/hasura + graphql-request 5 + graphql 15 | Hasura GraphQL data provider (`_bool_exp`, `order_by`, `_aggregate`, `_by_pk`, `_set`) and authored `meta.gqlQuery` / `meta.gqlMutation` execution | Angee pins `idType: "String"` and `namingConvention: "hasura-default"`, uses refine-compatible GraphQL document ASTs, and applies session/CSRF or service auth at the transport boundary |
| graphql-ws 5 | GraphQL WebSocket lifecycle for the Hasura live provider and daemon-owned operator transport | Endpoint derivation, connection params, retry policy, and the operator daemon subscription + raw log socket transport — request/response now rides a Refine `operator` data provider, leaving only the intrinsically streaming surfaces on this ws transport |
| GraphQL Code Generator (client-preset) + @graphql-typed-document-node/core | Generated TypeScript schema and operation types from emitted Django SDL and daemon-owned SDL, as `TypedDocumentNode` documents | `@angee/app` owns the one `angee-web-codegen` CLI: it reads `runtime/web/manifest.json`, generates each Django schema from `runtime/schemas/<schema>.graphql` (routing documents by filename: `documents.ts`/`documents.console.ts` → console, `documents.public.ts` → public), derives authored action/aggregate/group/delete-preview/revision documents, and emits the composed `runtime/web/app.ts`. The operator daemon joins the same pass as an external `[web].codegen` manifest entry — its committed SDL read straight from the operator package, scanning only `documents.daemon.ts`, with a bare `typescript` types module the console re-exports; authored operations carry no hand-written result/variables types |
| TanStack Router | Type-safe routing and search params | `defineAddon` to `createApp` route composition and flat URL search codec |
| @refinedev/react-hook-form + react-hook-form + @hookform/resolvers + zod | Form state, submit lifecycle, and validation binding | `FormView` keeps Angee's declarative rendered DSL while delegating state/validation to refine/react-hook-form |
| @refinedev/react-table + TanStack Table | Server-backed table state, sort/filter/pagination bridge, columns, grouping, selection | `ListView` and `BoardView` keep Angee's rendered controls and domain view modes while delegating standard table/data mechanics |
| TanStack Virtual | Row and column virtualization | Long-list wiring |
| nuqs | Type-safe URL query state | Remaining chrome query state such as top-menu tabs |
| i18next | Runtime i18n | Per-addon namespace convention |
| date-fns | Date and relative-time formatting | Date and timestamp widgets |
| use-debounce | Debounced React values and callbacks | Search and filter inputs |
| Tailwind 4 | Token styling engine | Semantic token set |
| tailwind-merge | Safe class merging | `cn()` helper |
| lucide-react | Icons | Name-referenced icon registry |
| Vite | Bundling, dev server, HMR | Project integration |
| @agentclientprotocol/sdk | ACP client — agent JSON-RPC session, prompt/cancel, session-update stream (the agent image runs `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`; both replace the deprecated `@zed-industries/*` names) | WebSocket ndjson transport to a routed agent + assistant-ui runtime bridge |
| @assistant-ui/react | Chat thread UI — message store, composer, tool-call rendering | ACP-streaming runtime adapter and styled thread surface |
| streamdown | Streamed-markdown render for assistant chunks | Assistant message body in the agent chat |
| react-pdf (+ pdfjs-dist) | Inline PDF rendering (pdf.js) | storage file previewer |
| @vidstack/react | Inline video/audio player | storage file previewer |
| heic-to | Client-side HEIC/HEIF decode to a displayable image (current libheif-wasm) | storage HEIC previewer |
| pnpm | JavaScript dependency resolution and workspaces | Workspace layout |
| Node >= 22.13 | JavaScript build runtime | Project runtime |

Chat-UI library choice: `@assistant-ui/react` owns the chat-UX surface (composed
over ACP); CopilotKit and `@headlessui/react` were evaluated and rejected, and
TanStack AI is a watch item.

## Hasura Dialect Rule

`strawberry-django-hasura`, the operator daemon SDL, `@refinedev/hasura`, and
Angee's refine/data glue share one Hasura-default wire contract. Because the
daemon already speaks this contract, the operator web package consumes it as a
Refine `operator` data provider (bearer-authed `createAngeeHasuraDataProvider`)
for request/response, the same shape as the `console`/`public` providers; only
its live subscriptions and the raw log socket stay on the daemon ws transport.
Grouped
resources must keep the DDN/NDC-preview shape:
`<resource>_groups(group_by, where, having, order_by, limit, offset): [<resource>_group!]!`,
with each group returning a typed `key: <Model>GroupKey!` and the free
`aggregate: <Model>Aggregate!`. The stock `<resource>_aggregate` root remains
the unmodified refine/Hasura aggregate surface; grouped roots are authored
operations owned by the dialect adapters.

Future grouped features such as bucket ordering, bucket predicates, additional
date extraction, or JSON drill-down operators must be added at the dialect
owners together: the Django adapter, operator SDL, emitted resource metadata,
and the refine authored-operation helpers. Do not add frontend-only group
semantics or local provider dialects.

## Rendered Binding

Angee's frontend is Refine-native: the app composes one `<Refine>` root, resource
metadata projects into refine resources, and the rendered binding owns only
domain presentation over refine state. The active frontend owners are
`@angee/app`, `@angee/refine`, `@angee/resources`, and `@angee/ui`.

| Pick | Owns | Angee adds |
|---|---|---|
| @base-ui/react | Headless primitives: dialog, popover, menu, tabs, tooltip, field, toolbar, scroll area, and related UI | Styled binding and composition rules; controlled `open`/`onOpenChange` owns popover/dialog transition timing |
| @floating-ui/react-dom | Floating-element positioning and virtual anchors | Popover and menu anchoring |
| @angee/logo-react | Angee brand logo and cube marks | Brand lockup in the public layout |
| react-markdown + remark-gfm | Markdown rendering (GitHub-flavored) | Markdown widget preview |

| tw-animate-css | Tailwind 4 animation utilities | Motion tokens |
| cmdk | Command menu | Spotlight command surface |
| react-day-picker | Calendar | Date widgets |
| react-resizable-panels | Split panes | Layout and inspector panes |
| CodeMirror 6 (+ @codemirror/lang-json) | Text / Markdown / JSON editor | Markdown and JSON widget editors (shared `useCodeMirrorEditor`) |
| @xyflow/react | node/edge graph canvas | `@angee/base` `GraphView` canvas |
| @dagrejs/dagre | directed-graph layout | `@angee/base` `GraphView` node placement |
| @dnd-kit | Drag and drop | Board and rail interactions |
| Native browser drag/drop | File drag enter/leave/drop events and `DataTransfer.files` | `@angee/base` upload drop target primitive |

| Playwright | Browser tests | `@angee/e2e` harness: workspace-isolated runner, role `storageState` login, GraphQL `api` fixture, Page Object base (`docs/testing/e2e.md`) |
| @playwright/mcp | Interactive browser-driving for host coding agents | Repo-root `.mcp.json` server (npx-run, pinned), bound to the base stack's `chrome-profile` (`.angee/data/chrome`); the agent navigates to the stack's `ANGEE_UI_PORT` (`:5173`). Distinct from `@angee/e2e` (the deterministic test runner) and `agents.MCPServer` (the MCP config rendered for operator-provisioned product agents) |
