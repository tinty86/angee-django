# Opinionated Stack

This file is the source of truth for the libraries Angee binds and what each one
owns. The stack is opinionated so product and addon work starts from settled
choices instead of re-litigating infrastructure. If a concern is listed here,
use the library's native shape and keep Angee as thin glue.

Dependency changes must update this file in the same change.

## How The Stack Is Locked

- `docs/stack.md` owns concern boundaries: which library owns which job, and
  what thin glue Angee adds.
- `pyproject.toml` owns Python package metadata, workspace membership, tool
  configuration, and declared Python dependencies. `uv.lock` pins the resolved
  Python graph. Use `uv add` / `uv lock`; do not use `pip install` by hand.
- `package.json` owns JavaScript package scripts and declared dependencies.
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` owns workspace membership. `pnpm-lock.yaml` pins the
  resolved JavaScript graph. Use `pnpm add` / `pnpm install`; do not use npm or
  yarn.
- A dependency change is complete only when the concern row here and the
  relevant manifest or lockfile agree.

## Backend

| django-environ | Typed boot environment access and URL parsers | `angee.compose.settings` reads Angee bootstrap env vars |
| pyjwt[crypto] | JWT and JOSE verification | OIDC discovery and exchange orchestration |
| mcp (jlowin FastMCP v2) | MCP server — tool registration, JSON-RPC, StreamableHTTP ASGI app, bearer auth (`TokenVerifier`), per-call middleware | Mounts one StreamableHTTP app at `/mcp` via the `asgi.py` `http_mounts` seam (its `http_app` lifespan entered by `angee.asgi` via `router.lifespan_context`), authenticates the bearer to a REBAC actor with a `fastmcp.server.auth.TokenVerifier` and brackets each tool call in that actor; addon tools — incl. `GraphQLTool` operations executed under the actor (`angee.mcp.graphql`) — run scoped, and rebac authorizes |
| anthropic | Anthropic Claude API SDK — Messages API client, model catalogue, retries, typed SDK models | `agents_integrate_anthropic` maps Angee inference providers/models to the SDK and contributes the backend into `ANGEE_INFERENCE_BACKEND_CLASSES` |
| openai | OpenAI Python SDK — Chat Completions client, model catalogue, retries, typed SDK models | `agents_integrate_openai` maps Angee inference providers/models to the SDK and contributes the backend into `ANGEE_INFERENCE_BACKEND_CLASSES` |

| uv | Python dependency resolution and workspaces | Workspace layout |

## Frontend

| Pick | Owns | Angee adds |
|---|---|---|
| React 19 | View library | Component conventions |
| TypeScript >= 6 | Language and type system | Branded boundary types |
| @refinedev/core | Resource registry, standard data hooks, react-query cache/invalidation, auth/i18n/live provider contracts | Angee projects emitted `angee.resources` metadata to refine resources and mounts one composed `<Refine>` root with named providers and the TanStack Router binding |
| @refinedev/hasura + graphql-request 5 + graphql 15 | Hasura GraphQL data provider (`_bool_exp`, `order_by`, `_aggregate`, `_by_pk`, `_set`) and authored `meta.gqlQuery` / `meta.gqlMutation` execution | Angee pins `idType: "String"` and `namingConvention: "hasura-default"`, uses refine-compatible GraphQL document ASTs, and applies session/CSRF or service auth at the transport boundary |
| graphql-ws 5 | GraphQL WebSocket lifecycle for the Hasura live provider and daemon-owned operator transport | Endpoint derivation, connection params, retry policy, and the operator daemon quarantine until that transport has its own non-app owner |
| GraphQL Code Generator (client-preset) + @graphql-typed-document-node/core | Generated TypeScript schema and operation types from emitted Django SDL and daemon-owned SDL, as `TypedDocumentNode` documents | Each project web package owns a `codegen` script that emits `runtime/gql/<schema>` from `runtime/schemas/<schema>.graphql`, routed to a Django schema by document filename (`documents.ts`/`documents.console.ts` → console, `documents.public.ts` → public); the operator web package owns a separate daemon client-preset run from `schema/operator.graphql` scanning only `documents.daemon.ts`; authored operations carry no hand-written result/variables types |
| TanStack Router | Type-safe routing and search params | `defineAddon` to `createApp` route composition and flat URL search codec |
| @refinedev/react-hook-form + react-hook-form + @hookform/resolvers + zod | Form state, submit lifecycle, and validation binding | `FormView` keeps Angee's declarative rendered DSL while delegating state/validation to refine/react-hook-form |

## Hasura Dialect Rule

`strawberry-django-hasura`, the operator daemon SDL, `@refinedev/hasura`, and
Angee's refine/data glue share one Hasura-default wire contract. Grouped
resources must keep the DDN/NDC-preview shape:
`<resource>_groups(group_by, where, having, order_by, limit, offset): [<resource>_group!]!`,
with each group returning a typed `key: <Model>GroupKey!` and the free
`aggregate: <Model>Aggregate!`. The stock `<resource>_aggregate` root remains
the unmodified refine/Hasura aggregate surface; grouped roots are authored
operations owned by the dialect adapters.

Future grouped features such as bucket ordering, bucket predicates, additional
date extraction, or JSON drill-down operators must be added at the dialect
owners together: the Django adapter, operator SDL, emitted resource metadata,
and the refine authored-operation helpers. Do not add frontend-only group
semantics or local provider dialects.

## Rendered Binding

Angee's frontend is Refine-native: the app composes one `<Refine>` root, resource
metadata projects into refine resources, and the rendered binding owns only
domain presentation over refine state. During the current package split,
composition/runtime contracts still live in `@angee/sdk`, provider/resource glue
in `@angee/data`, and rendered UI in `@angee/base`; the target owners are
`@angee/app`, `@angee/refine`, `@angee/resources`, and `@angee/ui`.

|---|---|---|
| @base-ui/react | Headless primitives: dialog, popover, menu, tabs, tooltip, field, toolbar, scroll area, and related UI | Styled binding and composition rules; controlled `open`/`onOpenChange` owns popover/dialog transition timing |
| @floating-ui/react-dom | Floating-element positioning and virtual anchors | Popover and menu anchoring |
| @angee/logo-react | Angee brand logo and cube marks | Brand lockup in the public layout |
