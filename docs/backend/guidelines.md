# Backend Guidelines

Backend code is Python, Django, and the composer. It owns data, permissions,
transport-neutral business behavior, and generated contracts.

Follow the shared development process and coding principles in
[`docs/guidelines.md`](../guidelines.md) for every task; the rules below are the
backend-specific layer applied during the Build step.

## Stack

The opinionated stack in `docs/stack.md` is the source of truth for backend
libraries and what each one owns. Check it before adding a dependency or
hand-rolling a concern. Python dependency setup belongs in `pyproject.toml` and
`uv.lock`.

## Django-Native Rule

Angee is not a second framework on top of Django. It is a build-time composer
for Django apps.

Before adding an Angee abstraction, ask: does Django already have an object,
method, or convention that owns this fact?

Use Django's native owners:

- App facts live on `AppConfig`.
- Model behavior lives on models, managers, and querysets.
- Value coercion lives on fields.
- Command dispatch lives in Django management commands and `argparse`.
- Table names, app labels, migrations, and model metadata follow Django
  defaults.

Angee code should own only the composition seam: discovering addons, ordering
them deterministically, emitting runtime apps, merging schemas, syncing
resources, and failing fast on collisions.

A wrapper must prove it adds a real new concept. If it only forwards,
normalizes, or renames a Django object, delete it.

## Package Layering

The framework core is three packages with a one-way dependency rule that a test
enforces:

- `angee.base` is the runtime foundation (models, mixins, graphql, serving,
  settings helper). It must not import `angee.compose` or `angee.resources`.
- `angee.resources` is the resource subsystem. It may import `angee.base`, never
  `angee.compose`.
- `angee.compose` is the build-time composer. It may import `angee.base` and may
  read resource declarations during build-time composition, but no serving module
  (`asgi`, `urls`, `views`, `consumers`, `signals`, `models`, `graphql`) may
  import `angee.compose`.

Rules that follow from the layering:

- **Addon discovery is a runtime registry read**, not a build-only concern:
  serving code (schema building, ASGI routing) enumerates installed addons too.
  It lives in the lowest package that serves both runtime and build —
  `angee.base` — so serving code never imports `angee.compose` just to list
  addons; `angee.compose` imports it from `angee.base`.
- **A management command must live in an installed Django app.** A non-addon
  package that owns commands (the composer, the resource subsystem) provides a
  plain `AppConfig` and is installed, and is excluded from `BaseAddonConfig`
  discovery (discovery collects only `BaseAddonConfig` instances).
- **Build and run use different `INSTALLED_APPS`.** The settings helper emits a
  build app set (source addons + the composer command host) and a run app set
  (runtime base + the resource command host + source addons). Build mode is the
  explicit `ANGEE_BUILD` setting; `AppConfig.import_models()` uses it to skip
  generated model adoption while `angee build` emits sources. `makemigrations`,
  `migrate`, resource loading, and SDL rendering run later in a fresh
  run-settings process that loads the freshly emitted concrete models normally.
- **The resource ledger is contributed by the composer.** The composer imports
  the resource ledger source model and emits it under the `base` label at build
  time. `angee.base` must not name or import `angee.resources`.
- **Refer to an emitted concrete model through the app registry**
  (`apps.get_model("base", "Resource")`), never by importing the generated
  `runtime/` tree.

## Rules

- Domain behavior lives on models, managers, and querysets.
- Source model discovery should follow Django model inheritance and explicit
  model-owned declarations, not naming or field-shape heuristics.
- Put behavior on the object that owns the shape, the Django way: coerce values
  with `Field.to_python`/`get_prep_value` instead of branching on field type from
  outside; ask `model._meta` (`get_field`, `label_lower`) and
  `Field.value_from_object` rather than re-decoding model shape; surface query
  behavior through `Manager.from_queryset`; and give objects classmethod factories
  and `deconstruct`-style methods to construct and serialize themselves. This is
  the backend application of **Find the owner** in `AGENTS.md` and the
  Django-Native Rule above.
- Compose behavior onto the class that owns the data. When several functions
  take the same object and read, transform, or emit from it, that object should
  be a class and those functions its methods — the runtime build owns its own
  plan/emit/check/reset (e.g. an `AngeeRuntime` object), not a module of loose
  functions wrapped around a passive dataclass. Keep a module-level function only
  for orchestration that genuinely has no owner, and prefer forming a cohesive
  class even then. A dataclass that only holds fields while a sibling module
  mutates and emits from it is a missing class. Organizing behavior into named
  files and classes is what keeps the framework consistent and normalized: a
  class is a fixed home that forces related behavior together and resists the
  drift that loose, scattered functions invite.
- Imports go at the top of the module. A function-local or deferred import is a
  smell that a module boundary is wrong — an import cycle, or a layer reaching
  across a seam — so fix the seam (move the shared fact to its owning module, or
  invert the dependency) instead of hiding the import inside a function. Two
  exceptions, both narrow: a dependency that is genuinely optional at runtime
  (isolate it behind its own module), and Django's app-loading order — an
  `AppConfig` module is imported in app-populate phase 1, before the registry is
  ready, so it must defer importing model classes (and signal wiring that pulls
  them in) until a method runs after `ready()`. Mark such a deferral with a
  comment naming the reason; everywhere else, hoist. Within `src/angee` these are
  the only function-local imports allowed — phase-1 deferrals and `TYPE_CHECKING`
  blocks. Probe optional or generated modules with `importlib.util.find_spec`
  (verifying each parent first) rather than `try/except ImportError`, so an absent
  generated `runtime/` reads as "not built yet," not a swallowed error.
- A pure renderer that takes its owner and returns a value with no other state may
  stay a module-level function in the owner's module; make it a method only when
  it reads more than one field of the owner or shares state with sibling helpers.
- A package `__init__.py` whose sole job is re-exporting a stable public API is a
  compatibility surface; `__all__` is allowed there (the usual "avoid `__all__`"
  rule targets ordinary modules).
- When restructuring or lifting existing code, reconstruct each module from its
  contract, tests, and these guidelines — do not paste or mechanically port the
  old code, and do not keep the old modules importable inside `src/angee`.
- Source models are abstract. Concrete apps are emitted by the composer.
- Keep Django `Meta` for Django and library-owned options such as
  `rebac_resource_type`; Angee extension facts live on the owning model class.
- `runtime/`, generated schemas, migrations, and codegen stubs are output.
  Change the source, not the artifact.
- REBAC is structural and owned by `django-zed-rebac`. Addons declare
  `permissions.zed`; Angee renders the combined permission schema at build time.
  Permission sync is the library's own `manage.py rebac sync`. Use the library's
  field-backed relations (`// rebac:field=...`) when a relationship is already
  represented by a Django FK or one-to-one field.
- GraphQL authoring is native Strawberry. Addons expose a `schemas` mapping in
  conventional `graphql.py` modules. Each named schema contributes Strawberry
  types into fixed buckets (`query`, `mutation`, `subscription`, `types`,
  `extensions`); Angee merges buckets across addons and builds one Strawberry
  `Schema` per name.
- Use symbolic model references across addon boundaries; avoid import cycles.
- Build output must be byte-deterministic.

## Framework Contracts

Framework contracts should be self-explaining in code. Add docstrings to public
modules, classes, methods, functions, declarative manifest attributes, and public
module-level constants. Add docstrings to private helpers when their role is not
obvious from the function name and signature. Do not maintain a parallel spec, field inventory, or model
API list for behavior that can live clearly beside the code.

`AppConfig` is the addon manifest and owns addon-local interpretation. Use
Django's own facts before adding an Angee fact: the addon root is
`AppConfig.path`, source models live in `models.py`, and GraphQL contributions
live in `graphql.py`. Put validation, normalization, and path resolution for one
addon on the `AppConfig` subclass. Prefer methods on the object that owns the
data — the `AppConfig` for one addon, a runtime build object for composition —
over loose functions; keep a function loose only for orchestration no single
object owns. Put current manifest attributes and their exact authoring forms in
the `AppConfig` base class docstrings, not in this guideline.

Before decomposing backend code, classify each fact by its Django owner:

- Persisted choices live beside the model field, usually as model-owned
  `TextChoices`.
- Row-set behavior lives on managers and querysets.
- Instance behavior lives on model methods and properties.
- Addon declaration and path-resolution behavior lives on `AppConfig`.
- Management commands parse arguments and dispatch to the owning model, manager,
  service, or composer function.
- Compatibility facades exist only for an explicit compatibility promise.

Settings helpers are pure functions of their arguments: they return plain
Django setting mappings and do not read the environment. Do not pass `globals()`
into framework code or let helpers mutate a settings module from the outside;
the host may apply the returned mapping in one visible step. The host owns where
runtime and data live — it resolves any `ANGEE_RUNTIME_DIR` / `ANGEE_DATA_DIR`
override and passes explicit paths to the helper. Anchor host defaults to a
fixed location via `__file__` (e.g. the repo-root control directory), never to
the current working directory.

Keep `angee` as a namespace package. Do not add `src/angee/__init__.py`; split
addon distributions must be able to contribute packages under the shared
`angee.*` namespace.

Avoid `__all__` unless a module has a concrete star-import or compatibility
requirement. Public API should usually be obvious from module names, object
names, and docstrings.

## Naming

Naming is structural: Django and the composer both locate code by name, so a
wrong name is a broken contract, not a style nit. Django is the reference — match
it exactly.

- **Modules** are lowercase, single-word, named by role: `models.py`,
  `managers.py`, `admin.py`, `forms.py`, `urls.py`, `apps.py`, `signals.py`,
  `mixins.py`, `validators.py`, `fields.py`, `backends.py`.
- **Structural directories** are fixed and discovered by name — never rename them:
  `migrations/`, `management/commands/`, `templatetags/`, `templates/`,
  `backends/`.
- **Packages / addons** are short and lowercase — no CamelCase, no stray
  underscores (`auth`, `contenttypes`, `storage`) — and match the addon label.
- **Classes** are PascalCase with a role suffix that mirrors the module: `*Field`,
  `*Mixin`, `*Manager`, `*QuerySet`, `*Form`, `*Admin`, and `*Config` for the
  `AppConfig`.
- **Methods / functions** are snake_case and verb-first from a stable vocabulary:
  `get_*` (accessors), `is_*` / `has_*` (booleans), `as_*` / `to_*` / `from_*`
  (conversions), `create_*` / `save_*` / `delete_*` (mutations);
  `_leading_underscore` for internal. Settings and constants are `UPPER_SNAKE`.
- **camelCase only when extending an external API that uses it** (e.g. Django's
  `unittest` assertions). Otherwise never.

## Checks

Run the narrowest relevant check while editing, then the broad check before
handoff:

```sh
uv run ruff check . --no-cache
uv run mypy src/
uv run pytest
uv run examples/notes-angee/manage.py angee build --check
```

If a command is not wired yet, say so plainly.
