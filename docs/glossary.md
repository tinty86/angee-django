# Glossary

Shared vocabulary for working in this repository. Terms are defined once here;
other docs link to this file instead of redefining them. This is a living
document — add a term when it first needs explaining, and keep each definition to
the smallest accurate statement.

## Composition

**Angee** — a thin composition framework that binds proven libraries into one
deterministic product surface. It owns the seams, not the concerns.

**Addon** — the unit of capability. An addon declares a contract (source models,
operations, routes, slots, resources) that the composer assembles into a project.
Everything, including the framework core, is an addon.

**Framework addon** — an addon that is part of Angee itself. The framework core is
the foundational framework addon; other base addons ship with Angee and build on
it. Inherited by every project downstream, so held to the highest bar.

**Consumer addon** — an addon written by a product team for a specific project,
built on top of the framework and base addons.

**Composer** — the build-time tool that turns addon contracts into a runnable
project: it reads each addon's source models and declarations and emits the
concrete Django apps, schema, and other `runtime/` artifacts. Composition happens
at build time — nothing is monkey-patched or registered at runtime.

**Host app (host)** — the application at the root of a project that composes the
chosen addons into the running product. A project contains one host; the host
composes addons.

**Project** — a runnable product: a host app plus the addons it composes.

**Addon contract** — what an addon declares for the composer to consume (source
models and their `Meta`, GraphQL overrides, routes, slots, resources). Contracts
are the seams between addons.

**Seams** — the named extension points and boundaries the framework owns. The
framework owns the seams; addons own the concerns. Extension is mechanical: named
hooks, explicit owners, deterministic order, fail-fast on collisions.

## Backend

**Source model** — an abstract Django model defined in an addon. Source models are
abstract; the composer emits concrete apps from them. You edit source models, not
the emitted output.

**Concrete app** — a runtime Django app emitted by the composer from source models.
Generated output — change the source, not the artifact.

**`runtime/`** — the directory of generated backend output (concrete apps, schemas,
codegen stubs, migrations). Output, not source.

**`Meta`** — the declarative backend contract attached to a model. Unknown keys
fail early.

**REBAC** — Relationship-Based Access Control (via `django-zed-rebac`).
Authorization is structural: reads scope through the model manager, writes check
the instance.

**Symbolic model reference** — referring to a model by symbol/string across addon
boundaries instead of importing it, to avoid import cycles.

**Virtual operation** — a GraphQL operation that is not derived from a model.
Handwritten `graphql/` code exists only for virtual operations and non-model
types; model-backed GraphQL is auto-generated.

## Frontend

**`defineAddon`** — the frontend entry point an addon uses to contribute routes,
views, slots, and other UI to the composition.

**`createApp`** — the frontend entry point the host uses to compose addons into the
running app.

**Slot** — an additive extension point in the component tree. Contribute to a slot
before copying or forking a component.

**Token** — a semantic styling value (Tailwind). Theme by overriding tokens rather
than passing color props or one-off variants.

**Rendered binding** — `@angee/base` is the single rendered (styled) binding;
`@angee/sdk` stays headless.
