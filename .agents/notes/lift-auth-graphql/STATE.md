# Auth + GraphQL Lift — durable state (compaction lifeline)

**This file is the source of truth for the in-flight program. Re-read it after any
compaction before acting.** Keep it updated as work lands.

## ✅ M3 production frontend — current branch state (2026-05-31)
Branch `workspace/m3-frontend` is rebased on `wip-base-lift-refactor` and carries
the production rebuild commits through P6:

- `8537eda` dependency manifest + `docs/stack.md` owner rows.
- `dfa5174` P1 view seams: Element DSL, data-view model/provider, widget registry,
  modal/confirm host.
- `6303908` P2 chrome/shell/chatter.
- `57f96fc` production frontend surfaces: login, public shell, markdown editor,
  list/form/data page rebuilds, notes reference config, SDK aggregation support.
- `bbfd5c5` Activity chatter wired to `noteRevisions(id)`.
- `dfcc785` record chrome pager + shared view switcher in the
  `DataPage`/`FormView`/`ListView` seam.

Fresh verification after `dfcc785`: `pnpm --filter @angee/base exec tsc --noEmit`,
`pnpm -r typecheck`, `pnpm --filter @angee/base exec vitest run`, `pnpm run test`,
`pnpm run build`, `uv run ruff check . --no-cache`, `uv run mypy src/`,
`uv run pytest`, `uv run examples/notes-angee/manage.py schema --check`, and
`uv run examples/notes-angee/manage.py angee build --check` all exited 0.

Live browser evidence now covers login/list, grouped table, record drawer with
`3 of 3` pager, previous-record navigation to `2 of 3`, record view switch back to
board, and live `noteChanged` invalidation: a separate localhost HTTP client
mutated "Reading list" to "Reading list websocket"; the already-open browser list
updated without reload, then the title was restored through the same GraphQL path
and the browser reflected the restore. The dev stack was stopped afterward.

Remaining before claiming the whole P7 bar complete: reviewer passes are not
available in this session, and the full browser walkthrough still lacks fresh
proof for every acceptance subcase (notably create/edit/status-transition and
list paging with more than one page of data). Continue from the production plan,
keeping commits phase-quality and provenance-free.

## ✅ M3 Phase 1 DONE — SDK → new contract + offset pagination (gate green)
The SDK now consumes the emitted contract: relay `ID!` nodes, real
`NoteStatus`/`Ordering`/`NoteGroupBy` enums, `NoteOrder @oneOf`, `NoteFilter`
lookup objects, verb-first `createNote(data:)`/`updateNote(data: NotePatch)`/
`deleteNote(id:)`, the new cascade `DeletePreview`, one
`noteAggregate(groupBy:)→{count,groups[]}` (count-only), `login(username,password)`/
`logout:Boolean`/`currentUser→UserType` (role-gating deferred, F6), and per-model
`<model>Changed` subscriptions on the **console** client (registry made
observable; `RelayInvalidationProvider({client})` opens one sub per model in view).
**Pagination = OFFSET (architect chose jump-to-page).** Backend swapped
`strawberry_django.connection` → `offset_paginated` (notes list), `OffsetPaginated`
exported from `angee.base.graphql`. SDK list hook does offset paging with real
jump-to-page (`setPage`), `total`/`pageCount` from backend `totalCount`. SDK fixture
stays a synthetic neutral `Sale` (framework stays consumer-model-free); document
tests validate against it. Gate: SDK codegen+typecheck+**106 vitest**; backend ruff,
`mypy src/`, **101 pytest**, example **15 tests**, `build --check` — all green.
Files: `packages/sdk/src/{selection,resource-result,resource-hooks,aggregates,
aggregate-extract,auth,auth-hooks,relay-registry,relay-invalidation,cache-config}.ts(x)`
+ tests, `schema/contract.graphql`, `codegen.ts`, `index.ts`; backend
`src/angee/base/graphql/__init__.py`, `examples/notes-angee/src/example/notes/schema.py`,
`tests/test_iam_graphql.py`. react-reviewer pass applied: page-reset moved to
render-time (no stale-offset fetch), `parseCurrentUser` boundary guard (no
"undefined undefined"), `variables` memo keyed by serialized filter/order, `hasNext`
simplified, invalidation provider uses a Fragment (headless). NOT yet committed
(await architect). Next: Phase 2 (@angee/base).

## ▶ M3 FRONTEND — Phases 1–4 DONE + gate green; Phase 5 = user's browser click-through
Commits: `1e53680` (P1 SDK→offset contract), `5fac779`/`443d8be`/`7380853` (P2
@angee/base: foundation+tokens / 22 primitives / createApp+views+shell+auth),
`baa9e4a` (P3 example notes+auth web app + /auth/csrf/), P4 (dev-stack Vite
service — template committed; rendered `.angee/angee.yaml` is workspace-local).
Reuse strategy worked: the prototype's base was on our stack, so primitives +
token system ported near-verbatim (provenance stripped) and the SDK-bound views/
createApp were reconstructed on the new offset hooks. **Full static gate GREEN:**
`pnpm -r typecheck` (sdk/base/notes-web/host), 106 sdk vitest, ruff, mypy src/
(52), 101 pytest, 15 example tests, build --check, host `vite build`. **Live dev
smoke GREEN:** Vite serves the SPA and transforms the whole module graph (?raw SDL
+ @angee/base + @angee/sdk + notes addon) with no errors. **Remaining (Phase 5):**
the visual browser click-through (login alice/alice → notes offset list/paging →
create/edit/delete → status filter → aggregate counts → live noteChanged) — needs a
browser; no browser tool in-session, so this is the user's check via `angee dev` ->
http://127.0.0.1:5173 (frontend) against Django on 8100. The GraphQL contract
itself (login/offset-notes/aggregate/REBAC) is already proven by the 15 example
HTTP tests.

## (historical) ▶ M3 FRONTEND — IN FLIGHT (full end-to-end, phased). Plan: `.agents/plans/m3-frontend.md`
Phase 1 committed (`1e53680`). **Phase 2 (@angee/base) IN PROGRESS** — strategy
locked (plan §Phase 2): the prototype's base is already on our stack
(base-ui + tailwind-variants + TanStack + lucide + valibot + cmdk). Reuse near-
verbatim (clean, strip provenance): the styling foundation (`lib/{cn,variants,
tailwind-merge-config}.ts`, `styles/{tokens,index}.css` — Tailwind 4 `@theme` token
system every primitive needs) + the `ui/` primitives notes+auth uses. Reconstruct on
the NEW SDK (prototype's views are old-SDK-coupled): ListView (offset pager),
FormView (TanStack Form + enum select), DataPage/ResourcePage, aggregate panel,
LoginPage + UsernamePasswordForm, app shell + createApp (wire console client into
RelayInvalidationProvider). Add only owner-rowed deps; avoid nuqs/date-fns/
floating-ui/use-debounce/react-markdown/@angee/logo-react (use TanStack Router
search, Intl, base-ui positioning, a local debounce). Skip xyflow/dnd/codemirror/
upload/json-ansi/wide-widget-catalog. NEXT: scaffold packages/base (package.json
stack-deps, tsconfig, exports), port the foundation+tokens, then primitives, verify
typecheck; then the SDK-bound views + app/shell/login.
Workspace `m3-frontend` (branch `workspace/m3-frontend`), off `main`. `angee dev`
runs the backend from here. Architect decisions: (1) full M3 now — SDK fix +
`@angee/base` + example web app + Vite dev-serving + browser e2e; (2) **pagination =
native keyset cursors; `totalCount` is backend-owned (read from the connection),
derive pages from it — never synthesize**; (3) **live updates = per-model
`<model>Changed` subscriptions on the console schema** (not the dead `events`
firehose). The local frontend is ONLY `packages/sdk` (no `@angee/base`, no example
web app yet); `angee dev` is backend-only today. The SDK is geared to the old
synthetic `Sale` schema — see the contract delta in the plan. Tasks #1–#5 track the
phases. Phase 1 (SDK→contract) first; it's what the architect flagged and the
foundation for the rest.

## ✅ M2 DONE — `angee dev` lifecycle + full SDL (current)
Compose/build/serve collapsed to **one boot, no `ANGEE_BUILD` flag**: the composer
emits the runtime in app-populate **phase 2** (`ComposeConfig.import_models`, ordered
before adopters), `AUTH_USER_MODEL` comes from the iam addon's `settings_defaults`,
the host owns+creates `ANGEE_DATA_DIR`, tolerant adoption, `from_settings` raises if
`ANGEE_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset, `emit_if_stale` is write-only (no boot-time brick).
Design: `.agents/plans/clean-build-schema-emit.md`. Dev manifest rewritten to the real
job graph (`build → makemigrations → migrate → rebac sync → resources → schema`; web =
`runserver`), no env-substitution artifacts. Commit `0a39096`.

**SDL completeness (the M2 acceptance bar) — VERIFIED in `runtime/schemas/public.graphql`:**
- **Pagination** = strawberry-django relay cursor connection
  (`NoteTypeCursorConnection`/`Edge`, `PageInfo`, `notes(before,after,first,last)`).
- **Enums** = `status` is a real GraphQL enum `NoteStatus {DRAFT,ACTIVE,ARCHIVED}` shared
  across `NoteType`/`NoteInput`/`NotePatch`/`NoteGrouped`, via `django-choices-field`
  (now a locked dep, `docs/stack.md:31`) + base `StateField` wrapper (`src/angee/base/fields.py`)
  + model `class Status(TextChoices)`; plus `NoteGroupBy` and `Ordering` enums.
- **Aggregates** = `noteAggregate(groupBy:[NoteGroupBy!]) → NoteAggregate{count,groups:[NoteGrouped]}`.
- **Filters/order** = `notes(filters: NoteFilter, order: NoteOrder)` via
  `strawberry_django.filter_type(lookups=True)` + `order_type`.
Gate: ruff + mypy + **101 pytest** + **14 example tests** + full e2e from a wiped
runtime/db (build→makemigrations→migrate→rebac→resources install+demo(11 rows)→schema→
schema --check) all green. Next: **M3 frontend** (greenfield; pnpm/Vite/urql exist as
`packages/sdk`).

## North-star goal (active Stop-hook condition)
Working `example/notes` **and** an `auth` addon **end-to-end**, strictly following
`AGENTS.md` + `docs/*` guidelines. No shortcuts, no workarounds, no codegen, step by
step clean code, **less code is better**, deferring to stack-owned libraries (rebac /
strawberry-django). Reconstruct, never copy; **no p1 baggage**; no provenance anywhere.

## ⚙ M1 BUILD STATUS (current)
- **Slice 1 DONE + committed `d009bbe`** ("Add GraphQL identity, REBAC, and denial-code
  seams"): `AngeeNode` (relay Node + sqid NodeID) in `base/graphql/node.py`, denial-code
  `Schema` subclass in `errors.py`, universal REBAC extensions in `build()`, `compose/rebac.py`
  deleted + combined `.zed` emit removed, addon GraphQL module `graphql.py`→`schema.py` (F5).
  Gate green (ruff/mypy/**91 pytest**), `build --check` ok. Verified by me.
- **Slices 2–7 NOT yet built** (WS mixin / `angee.iam`+composed User / demo users / login verbs /
  notes relay read-side / aggregates).
- **⚠ CODEX SANDBOX CANNOT COMMIT or write `.agents/`** (discovered: the first M1 build job
  `task-mptaxl16-09028z` spun 6h+ probing `.git`/`.agents` writability, never committed, got
  stuck; cancelled). Earlier round-1/round-2 dispatches committed fine — the companion runtime
  reset ("direct startup") changed the sandbox. **Protocol for codex re-dispatches:** instruct it
  to attempt a commit ONCE per slice and, if it fails, NOT loop — leave changes in the working
  tree and continue; never write to `.agents/` — report blockers in the final message; **I
  (main session) verify + commit.** Codex CAN edit `src/`/`tests/`/`docs/`/`examples/` (Slice 1
  proves it).

## ✅ M1 BUILD — slices 1–7 complete, cleaned, schema builds, committed
All 7 slices land. Gate green (ruff/mypy/**97 pytest**); `angee build --check`,
`manage.py schema`, and `manage.py test example.notes` (14 example tests) all pass; fresh-ledger
e2e (build → makemigrations iam base notes → migrate → rebac sync → resources load 11 rows →
login(alice)/currentUser → notes relay connection scoped to alice → bob sees only his notes at
root and via `node(id:)` → noteAggregate alice-scoped count=3 → anonymous mutation →
PERMISSION_DENIED) all green. Workarounds removed:
- **Relay Node interface** — `AngeeNode` is now a real `@strawberry.interface` over `relay.Node`
  declaring `sqid: relay.NodeID[str]`. Its own definition (not Node's inherited one) means the MRO
  yields two distinct interfaces (`AngeeNode`, `Node`), so the doubled-`Node` interface never
  appears. `normalize_node_interfaces` deleted.
- **Schema assembly bug** — root cause: relay `NodeExtension.apply` mutates the SAME shared
  `StrawberryField` when a surface (`NotesQuery`) is contributed to multiple named schemas
  (`public` + `console`); the second build re-applies and trips `assert base_resolver is None`.
  Fix lives at the merge seam: `GraphQLSchemas._merge_root` gives each named schema independent
  field copies (`copy.copy` of each merged-root field). The nested `revisions` connection is
  DROPPED — reversion `Version` is a Python property, not a REBAC-scopable Django relation, and
  Note has no genuine child relation to demo a nested connection over; the top-level `notes`
  connection is the must-have and works. `word_count` resolves via
  `@strawberry_django.field(only=["body"])`.
- **User-model dance** — `register_build_user_model()` + the `import_models` override are GONE.
  `AUTH_USER_MODEL="iam.User"` is set ONLY in the RUN app set; the emit-only BUILD keeps Django's
  default contrib.auth user (it only renders sources, never resolves the FK). The composer emits
  the concrete swappable `iam.User` into `runtime/iam/models.py`, so it resolves at run with no
  runtime registration.
- **depends_on** — `IAMConfig`/`NotesConfig` use plain `depends_on = ("base",)`; the unused
  `ClassVar` import dropped from iam/apps.py. `BaseAddonConfig.dependencies` now reuses
  `_normalize_depends_on`, so a bare-string `depends_on="base"` resolves to `("base",)`
  (test in tests/test_apps.py).
**Residual note:** `rebac.W003` on `notes.Note.created_by → iam.User` is an ORM select_related
hint, not a GraphQL leak — `created_by` is NOT exposed on `NoteType`, so there is no nested user
path to leak. M2 research (wuoceuykb) wires `manage.py schema` into `angee dev`.

## ⭐ STANDING PRINCIPLE (architect): WHEN STUCK, CHECK p1 — don't invent.
Any time the lift hits an issue (a library not doing what's expected, a "this needs a
workaround" moment), FIRST read how the **working prototype `../angee-django-p1`** solved it
(it uses the same libs — rebac/strawberry-django/aggregates — and works end-to-end). p1's
solution is the proven, library-native reference. Reconstruct from it; do NOT invent a
decorator/subclass/private-API-reach. This is why M1 grew hacks: codex invented instead of
consulting p1. Every cleanup fix must be grounded in p1's working approach AND the library's
public API. (Pairs with "ALWAYS PREFER A LIBRARY".) Concrete p1 references for the open M1
smells: auth user lookup-without-actor → p1 `src/angee/auth/{models,backends}.py`; aggregate
scoped-queryset → p1 `addons/angee/angee/graphql/aggregate_wiring.py`; relay connection
ordering / node → p1 `addons/angee/angee/graphql/{type_factory,runtime}.py`.

## ⛳ DIRECTION CHANGE (architect) — refactor M1 to p1's shape (SUPERSEDES the iam/no-shim/build-flag decisions)
The architect chose p1's shape over the current p2 shape, accepting p1's contrib.auth shim
as the trade for killing the build flag. When the in-flight review (`wczldvpbm`) lands,
dispatch ONE Claude agent (light context, CLEAR instructions, **do NOT run tests** — just make
the shape work) to refactor toward p1, grounded in `../angee-django-p1`:
1. **Rename `angee.iam` → `angee.auth`** (label `auth`); the auth label is owned by the
   generated runtime app (the abstract user emits with `app_label="auth"`).
2. **Add p1's `sys.modules` shim** (`auth/compat/auth_models_shim.py` + `install.py`) that lazily
   resolves `User`/`Group`/`Permission` via `apps.get_model("auth", ...)`, and **remove
   `django.contrib.auth` from INSTALLED_APPS** (so Django never runs the `auth.E*` checks that
   crash when `auth.User` isn't loaded). Accepted shim — architect's call.
3. **Constant `AUTH_USER_MODEL = "auth.User"`** in every mode.
4. **Kill the `ANGEE_BUILD` flag + the `_build_installed_apps`/`_run_installed_apps` fork** →
   ONE `compose_defaults`, ONE INSTALLED_APPS, ONE settings shape.
5. **Failure-tolerant `import_models`** (p1 core/apps.py:92-105): always `try` to import
   `runtime.<label>.models`; on `ModuleNotFoundError` whose `.name` is the runtime/label/target,
   `return` ("not built yet"); else re-raise. NO flag gate. "Don't worry about the imports" —
   use the try/except in import_models; don't fuss about imports-at-top for this.
6. While there, fold in the review's other confirmed smells (UserManager bypass, aggregate
   `_apply_scope_in_place`/`on_field_deny`, AngeeConnection, copy.copy) — fixed per p1's approach.
The agent REPORTS THE SHAPE (no test run); the architect checks the shape before we verify.

## The main thing (core intent — drives every milestone)
The point of this program is a **GraphQL contract change** and its propagation to the
client:
- **Pagination → standard GraphQL** (strawberry-django **relay connections**), replacing
  hand-rolled paging.
- **Aggregates / group-by work SERVER-SIDE** (via strawberry-django), not client-side.
- **Change how GraphQL is configured (server) AND consumed (client).**
- **Fix the SDK and the base UI** to consume the new standard pagination + the built
  queries.
So M1's read side must be relay-connection + server-side aggregates (no hand-rolled
paging/`NotesQuery`), and M3 rewrites the SDK + base UI to that contract. Keep "less
code is better": let strawberry-django own pagination/filtering/ordering/aggregation.

## Strategy (decided)
Three milestones, in sequence:
- **M1 — Auth + REBAC↔GraphQL lift** (current). Lift *just enough* from
  `../angee-django-p1` to make notes+auth work end-to-end on the new clean
  architecture. Scope: auth addon (User/Group/Service/ApiKey, password backend, login
  GraphQL verb, actor resolver → `REBAC_ACTOR_RESOLVER`); wire
  `rebac.graphql.strawberry.RebacExtension` + `rebac.graphql.strawberry_django.RebacDjangoOptimizerExtension`
  into `GraphQLSchemas.build()`; denial→GraphQL error formatter
  (`PermissionDenied`/`MissingActorError` → `UNAUTHENTICATED`/`PERMISSION_DENIED`);
  replace hand-rolled `AngeeGraphQLWSConsumer` with `rebac.graphql.strawberry.RebacChannelsConsumerMixin`;
  crud **read** side via strawberry-django (query/connection/node/filter/pagination/
  search) + opaque-id scalar; wire-or-delete `sync_permissions`; fix the example
  `manage.py test` graphql-module shadowing.
- **M2 — Dev stack / template.** Make `angee dev` work: build-watch, re-emit schema,
  makemigrations/migrate, load assets — via template hooks running these commands.
  Full GraphQL schemas; no UI/storybook yet. *"Make plans, let codex code."*
- **M3 — Frontend lift.** Fix the SDK and lift the p1 notes+auth frontend so login +
  full notes work end-to-end with standard GraphQL pagination and the built queries.
  Careful: no new bugs; record blockers, keep going in parallel.

## How we run the lift (the lift skill's automated workflow is DELETED/broken —
`.agents/workflows/lift.js` does not exist; commit `736fe3b Delete workflows`).
Orchestrate with our OWN `Workflow` runs, applying lift *principles*: reconstruct don't
copy, defer to the rebac/strawberry stack, land at the owning level, drop baggage.
Process: **understand → plan → review plan → codex builds on a workspace branch →
review build → land**. Do NOT corrupt the framework; build on the round-2-corrected base.

## In-flight right now (check status before acting)
- **Round-2 codex** — companion job `task-mpt7qzo8-hrcu9p`, codex session
  `019e7bd8-ce7d-7401-8dc6-a4efe95a3a84`. Fixing the 10 adversarially-verified
  round-2 findings (esp. the **critical xref label-alias canonicalization**). The lift
  must build on TOP of this. Status: `node <companion> status task-mpt7qzo8-hrcu9p`.
- **Understanding workflow** — `wm0rq9k5t` (run `wf_6052ae27-6a1`). Read-only; produces
  the minimal LIFT MAP (capability / lib_owned / reconstruct / drop_baggage /
  integration_seams / slices / risks / open_questions). When done, write the M1 plan
  from `map`, then proceed.
- Branch: `wip-base-lift-refactor`. Untracked `tests/test_instrument_tmp.py` is round-2
  codex scratch — leave it (codex owns it).

## Engines / paths
- codex companion: `/Users/alexis/.claude/plugins/cache/openai-codex/codex/1.0.4/scripts/codex-companion.mjs`
- `gemini`: /opt/homebrew/bin/gemini · `angee`: /usr/local/bin/angee
- Dispatch codex via the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent (Agent tool), not raw shell.
- p1 reference repo: `/Users/alexis/Work/fyltr/angee-django-p1` (read-only reference).

## Next concrete steps (autonomous)
1. When round-2 codex lands: re-run the gate myself (`ruff --no-cache`, `mypy`,
   `pytest`, `angee build --check`) **and a fresh/cleared-ledger example e2e** to
   confirm the xref label fix (the green unit gate missed the original regression).
2. Checkpoint commit.
3. When the understanding workflow lands: write `.agents/plans/lift-auth-graphql.md`
   from the LIFT MAP (minimal, clean-architecture, no baggage).
4. Quick adversarial plan review (workflow) → revise.
5. Build via codex on a workspace/branch (`angee ws create lift-auth-graphql` or a
   feature branch off the corrected base). Keep slices independently verifiable.
6. Adversarial code review (workflow) → fix loop → land.
7. Then M2, then M3.

## Understanding workflow: DONE (wm0rq9k5t). Map → plan written: `.agents/plans/lift-auth-graphql.md`.
Headline: most actor/REBAC plumbing is ALREADY WIRED or library-owned. M1 = wire rebac
lib classes + tiny error extension + login verb + read-side, and DELETE ~1600+ LOC of
p1 baggage. 7 slices (see the plan).

## ⚠ DIRECTIVE UPDATE (architect, supersedes F1): REPLACE Django's auth app
We are **replacing `django.contrib.auth`** with our own auth addon (custom user/group),
the way **p1 solved it with a compat shim** — NOT using the default `auth.User`. This
reverses F1's "use default auth.User / drop custom user / drop the shim."
- Study p1's mechanism (`compat/auth_models_shim.py` + `install.py`) — but p1 replaced
  `django.contrib.auth.models` in `sys.modules`, a **monkey-patch the constitution
  forbids**. Reconstruct the SAME capability cleanly: the Django-native swappable
  **`AUTH_USER_MODEL`** custom user (and our own Group/role surface) so consumers use
  `get_user_model()` and never `from django.contrib.auth.models import User` — no
  sys.modules patch. Confirm the exact clean shape from the investigation + p1's intent.
- Label-collision note flips: if `django.contrib.auth` is genuinely replaced/not installed,
  the addon CAN be label `auth`; if it stays installed (AUTH_USER_MODEL keeps contrib.auth
  for Group/Permission/admin machinery), keep a non-colliding label. Decide from the
  investigation (`wxafgtbrk` + the shim read).
- Aggregates fork RESOLVED: **use `../strawberry-django-aggregates`** (v0.2.2, py314; both
  p0/p1 depend on it) — add it as a dependency and wire it; do NOT hand-roll an ORM
  resolver. Reconstruct the capability WITHOUT p0/p1's codegen/emitter (`aggregates_emitter`,
  `runtime/aggregates.py`, Meta codegen hints) — we author the schema by hand.

## ⭐ STANDING PRINCIPLE (architect): ALWAYS PREFER A LIBRARY OVER BUILDING.
Before writing anything, find the library that owns it and wire it. For M1: Django's
swappable `AUTH_USER_MODEL` + `AbstractBaseUser`/`PermissionsMixin` for the user;
`rebac` (RebacPermissionsMixin/RebacBackend/actors/extensions/consumer-mixin) for authz;
`strawberry-django` for relay/filters/ordering; `strawberry-django-aggregates` for
aggregates; Django's own `authenticate`/`login` for credentials. We build ONLY the thin
seams the stack cannot own. Reject any hand-rolled equivalent of a library feature.

### p1 auth mechanism (mapped firsthand)
p1 set `AUTH_USER_MODEL = "auth.User"` where `auth` is **p1's OWN app** (`angee.auth`,
label `auth`); `django.contrib.auth` was **NOT installed**, and `compat/auth_models_shim.py`
+ `install.py` injected `django.contrib.auth.models` into `sys.modules` so third-party
imports kept working. That sys.modules injection is the **monkey-patch we must NOT
reproduce.** Clean equivalent (library-first): provide a custom user via the Django-native
swappable `AUTH_USER_MODEL` and make our own code use `get_user_model()` — no shim. **Open
design point (finalize from `wxafgtbrk`):** does contrib.auth stay installed (swap only the
User model — simplest, library-native) or get fully replaced (matches p1's REBAC-pure
intent but reintroduces the shim problem)? Lean: swap via `AUTH_USER_MODEL`, keep
contrib.auth for Group/Permission/admin machinery (which `RebacPermissionsMixin` neutralizes
anyway), unless the investigation shows a concrete blocker. If contrib.auth stays, the addon
label must not be `auth`; if it is genuinely replaced, label `auth` is free.

## Resolved forks (autonomous calls — review if you disagree)
- **F1 — auth model = DEFAULT `auth.User`.** Drop p1's custom User/Group/PermissionsMixin
  AND Service/ApiKey/ImpersonationEvent for M1. (Deviates from the original
  "User/Group/Service/ApiKey" brief, but matches "less code / no baggage / just enough";
  ApiKey/Service are product features with no role in notes+auth — defer to a later
  milestone if the product needs them.)
- **F2 — REBAC GraphQL extensions are UNIVERSAL in `base.GraphQLSchemas.build()`** (base
  imports `rebac.graphql.strawberry`; rebac is already a hard base dep). Not per-addon
  opt-in. Order is load-bearing: `[RebacExtension, RebacDjangoOptimizerExtension, DenialMapping]`.
- **F3 — session login (cookie) for M1** (contrib.sessions + AuthenticationMiddleware
  already wired). Token/bearer deferred.
- **F4 — denial codes: `UNAUTHENTICATED` + `PERMISSION_DENIED`** (Apollo standard + the
  user's item 3 spelling; p1 used NOT_AUTHENTICATED — deliberately diverge).
- **F5 — addon GraphQL contribution module = `schema.py`** (one discovery hook in
  apps.py resolves `schema`) — strawberry's idiom AND it kills the graphql-core import
  shadow so `manage.py test` works (item 11). **DECISION (architect): keep `schema.py`;
  make it INTENTIONAL** — document in `docs/backend/guidelines.md` + the Naming section
  that addon GraphQL contributions live in `schema.py` while the framework GraphQL
  *subsystem* is the `angee.base.graphql` package (a different kind of module). Both
  addons (iam, notes) already use `schema.py`; ensure every future addon does too.
- **F6 — defer `currentUser.role_refs`** (not needed for M1).
- **F7 — delete the combined runtime `permissions.zed` emit** (compose/runtime.py:67);
  `rebac sync` reads each addon's own `.zed` — one owner per fact. Also delete the dead
  framework `sync_permissions` wrapper.
- **F8 — align `crud()` update to resolve by opaque public id** (like delete) for a
  consistent id surface (part of the user's opaque-id intent).

## Plan de-risked (DONE — wijc5050v, verified vs installed libs). Refinements folded into the plan:
- **F1 refined:** the addon package is **`angee.accounts`** (label `accounts`), NOT
  `angee.auth` — label `"auth"` collides with `django.contrib.auth` and Django refuses to
  start. Registered framework-wide in BOTH app sets via `compose_defaults`. REBAC types stay
  `auth/user`/`auth/group` (independent of the Django app label).
- **F4 refined:** denial mapping is a **`strawberry.Schema` subclass overriding
  `process_errors`** (SchemaExtension has no `process_errors` hook). `MissingActorError`→
  `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `PermissionDenied`→`PERMISSION_DENIED`.
- **F7 corrected:** there is no `sync_permissions`. Delete the combined `permissions.zed`
  emit (`runtime.py:67`), the now-dead `compose/rebac.py` (`render_permissions`/
  `write_permissions`) + its import (`runtime.py:17`), and the generated on-disk
  `runtime/permissions.zed`; re-run `angee build` so `build --check` stays green; reconcile
  `docs/backend/guidelines.md:133`.
- Use the **rebac** optimizer subclass (`rebac.graphql.strawberry_django.RebacDjangoOptimizerExtension`),
  NOT the plain strawberry_django one (the plain one leaks related rows via the unscoped
  `_base_manager`).
- **F8 refined:** relay node id must be the **sqid** (`relay.NodeID[str]`), and update-by-
  opaque-id needs `key_attr="sqid"` (or a custom resolver mirroring `_delete_resolver`).

## ⚠ FORK NEEDING YOUR CALL — Slice 7 aggregates owner
`strawberry-django 0.86` has **no native aggregation**; `docs/stack.md:32` names
`strawberry-django-aggregates`, which is **not installed/locked**. Options: (a) lock
`strawberry-django-aggregates` (a dependency-manifest + `docs/stack.md` change — you own
those) and wire it; or (b) a minimal server-side ORM-backed resolver
(`with_actor(actor)` BEFORE `.values().annotate()`), no new dep. **Default for autonomous
progress: (b)**, flagged here for reconciliation. Tell me if you want (a).

## Decisions & forks log (review later if needed)
- **D1 (locked):** resource ledger ownership inverted into the **composer** (base
  imports nothing from resources). [round-1]
- **D2 (locked):** **compose is build-only**; SDL render moved to a base `schema`
  command; explicit `ANGEE_BUILD` flag replaced the INSTALLED_APPS sniff. [round-1]
- **D3 (locked):** xref identity = `(source_addon, xref)`, exact match + index,
  fail-fast. [round-1] — **round-2 correction:** canonicalize the addon ref through the
  alias registry (name/label interchangeable) BEFORE the exact match; do NOT
  reintroduce `__endswith`.
- **D4 (strategic):** Stop hand-rolling the WS actor; **lift the rebac library mixin**
  (`RebacChannelsConsumerMixin`) instead. Round-2's hand-rolled WS fix will be
  superseded by M1.
- **FORK (open):** auth addon level — is `auth` a base addon (framework-owned) or a
  consumer addon? Default per guidelines: a base/framework addon so every project
  inherits it, but confirm against the LIFT MAP's `reconstruct[].level`. Record final
  choice here.
- **FORK (open):** opaque-id scalar — framework-level scalar on `AngeeModel.public_id`
  vs per-addon. Default: framework-level (DRY). Confirm from map.

## Build recipe (concrete, durable): `.agents/notes/lift-auth-graphql/RECIPE.md`
Aggregates = `strawberry-django-aggregates` **compute layer only** (compiler/operators/
granularity/errors), author types by hand, **eager REBAC scope (managed manager → actor →
compute_aggregation)**; never import its codegen layer. M1 aggregate surface = `count` +
group_by (word_count is a @property, not summable — promote later for sum/avg). **AUTH LOCKED
(architect):** app = **`angee.iam`** (label `iam`); `iam.User` = AbstractBaseUser +
`rebac.RebacPermissionsMixin` + angee mixins (sqid), emitted by the composer,
`AUTH_USER_MODEL="iam.User"`; groups/roles/permissions owned by **REBAC** (`iam/permissions.zed`,
`RebacBackend` single authz source, no Django permission M2Ms); contrib.auth stays installed
(rebac/channels need Group/AnonymousUser), no shim. Full design + the swappable-composed-user
build concern in RECIPE.md.
