# Frontend Plan — Base UI Upgrade · ListView Freeze Fix · P1 UI Lift Inventory

This file consolidates two things:

- **Part A (§0–§9 below):** the frontend stack upgrade and the ListView hard-freeze — both
  **done** (committed `424dfba` + `40f3311`). History worth keeping: the freeze was first
  theorized as a Base UI popover *event-ordering* bug, then as a nuqs/`useTransition` DRY
  cleanup. **Both theories were wrong.** The real cause was **TanStack Table
  `autoResetPageIndex`** looping on a churning `rows` reference, which hard-locks
  Safari/WebKit; fixed in `ListView` (`autoResetPageIndex:false`) + `useResourceList`
  (memoize `extractPage`). The Base UI rc.0 → 1.5 upgrade shipped too, but as an
  **independent** cleanup off a deprecated package, *not* the fix.
- **Part B (appended below):** the **P1 UI lift inventory** — a forward-looking checklist of
  the entire P1 notes UI surface to reconstruct in this repo. Folded in verbatim from the
  former `.agents/plans/p1-ui-inventory.md` (status there: inventory, not implementation).

**North star:** less code, defer to the stack, find the owner.

## ⏯ Resume state — read first if this session was compacted (2026-06-01)

**Branch** `wip-base-lift-refactor`. **Goal:** enhanced/cleaner/denser reconstruction —
mockup look&feel + P1 features — **storybook-first** (Stage 1 visual → Stage 2 wire). Full
checklist in §10; file-level surface in the P1 UI Inventory (bottom).

**Committed:**
- `424dfba` — Base UI `rc.0` → `@base-ui/react@1.5.0` (rename across 14 sites + 3 ref-type fixes + deleted the `PopoverTrigger` rc-era hack).
- `40f3311` — ListView hard-freeze fix: `autoResetPageIndex:false` in `ListView.tsx` + memoize `extractPage(run.data)` in `useResourceList`. Safari/WebKit-verified (the freeze was TanStack Table, NOT the popover — earlier popover/`useTransition` theories were wrong).
- `ea860c3` — storybook-first master checklist (§10) + this resume block.
- `4740a6a` — **slice #1 accepted:** data-driven chrome icon registry (Glyph→runtime registry single owner; trimmed vocab; AppRail fallback; menu/nav icons render). Full cadence ran: codex lift → review caught the dual-registry → codex rework → verified clean + visual. Stage-1.0 follow-up: base-icon resolution in Storybook (§10 1.0/1.1).

**Uncommitted working tree:** only this plan's latest edits. No code pending.

**References & live services:**
- **Look&feel target:** mockup `../angee-console-mockups/angee-console-react` → http://localhost:5174/#/notes (user-run; dense grouped rows, status badges, tag chips, avatars). Screenshot it to compare.
- **HARD RULE — NEVER synthesize/guess a visual.** Every asset, markup, class set, and layout already exists in the mockup (`../angee-console-mockups/angee-console-react/{src,public}`) and P1. Pull the EXACT source and copy it verbatim (architect override permits visual copy). Do not approximate with library params or a lookalike. E.g. the brand mark IS the mockup's `public/logo-icon.svg` (now inlined as `chrome/AngeeMark.tsx`) — not an `AngeeLogo` geometry guess. If the exact source isn't found yet, FIND IT before writing; don't invent.
- **Feature source:** `../angee-django-p1` (P1, read-only). P1 storybook on :6006 failed to start.
- **Our app:** `angee dev` on :5173 (I control it; it dies when the launching shell exits — restart with `angee dev` backgrounded, then poll 5173).
- **Verify/repro harness (gitignored):** `examples/notes-angee/e2e/test-results/{check,repro2,repro3,shot,mockup}.mjs` — Playwright (chromium + webkit installed); login alice/alice; the freeze repro = load `/notes?group=updatedAt:year` then open the filter popover, check in **WebKit**.

**Engine & review:** lift via the **Codex plugin** (`codex:codex-rescue` subagent; `codex` CLI ready + ChatGPT auth). Every slice gets THREE reviews: `architecture-reviewer` + `react-reviewer` + **visual-vs-mockup** (the missing lens that let a weak look through).

**Open decisions:** D-A (nuqs vs TanStack Router search) gates Stage 2; token/visual-layout copy is allowed (architect override), all other logic reconstructed. **Resolved:** addon UI → `src/<namespace>/<addon>/web/` (e.g. `src/angee/auth/web/`), co-located with addon backend; base UI stays in `packages/base`. Storybook host → `packages/storybook/` (default, unless changed).

**Autonomous loop active:** `/loop` cron `bc7f168e` fires every 15 min — each fire checks Codex progress; if idle, runs the next §10 slice via Codex + reviewers (anchored to exact mockup/P1 sources, screenshot-vs-mockup gated); when the whole lift is done, builds e2e for all logins (alice/bob/admin) exercising every function/button.

**Next action / in-flight:** Icon slices committed (`4740a6a`, `bd4c934` real Angee mark). **Slice 1.0 (Storybook) ACCEPTED + committed** (`f709f0d` scaffold, `e1867a4` review-fixes). Full cadence ran: Codex lift → both reviewers (found a self-inflicted toolchain fork: unused `@vitejs/plugin-react@6` forced vite 8, plus `react-router-dom`/TS 6 divergence; and a TopMenu story that threw — no `NuqsAdapter`) → fixed (dropped the unused deps, realigned vite ^6 / TS ^5.7, added `NuqsTestingAdapter` to the preview decorator, `@types/node` ^22, tsconfig scoped to TS sources) → verified: workspace typecheck green, Storybook (`:6006`) runs, Button + TopMenu stories **render with icons** (screenshot `test-results/sb-topmenu.png`). Lesson reinforced: verify stories by rendering, not just typecheck.
**Full workspace upgrade — COMMITTED + functionally verified.** Codex bumped everything (vite 8, TS 6, vitest 4, happy-dom 20, urql core 6 + graphcache 9, lucide 1.17, @types/node 25, plugin-react 6) but its verify hung (killed stuck pnpm) and left breakage I fixed: (1) `graphql-client.ts` `FetchBody` import → `@urql/core/internal` (urql 6 moved it); (2) added `@types/react`/`@types/react-dom` to storybook (TS 6 jsx-runtime). **Workspace typecheck GREEN.** Runtime VERIFIED: app `:5173` loads "Records 1-50 / 10052" under urql 6/9, lucide 1.17 icons render. **RESOLVED:** the 10 `@angee/sdk` failures were urql 6's new default `preferGetMethod: 'within-url-limit'` — small queries went via GET (no POST body), so the tests' `bodies[]` assertions saw nothing. Fix is one line in the real client (`createUrqlClient`): `preferGetMethod: false` (the Django endpoint is CSRF-protected and reads the operation from the POST body). **ALL GREEN:** sdk 113 ✓, base 26 ✓, workspace typecheck ✓, app loads data ✓. Upgrade committed as one milestone. Next: reviewers on the upgrade diff, then §10 1.1 page layout.

**Next (architect, reprioritized):** **Upgrade the WHOLE workspace to latest NOW** — don't pin packages back. The storybook vite^6/TS^5.7 pins (`e1867a4`) are temporary; the real fix is leveling the workspace UP (vite→8, @vitejs/plugin-react→6, vitest→4, happy-dom→20, typescript→6, @types/node→25, @urql/core→6, @urql/exchange-graphcache→9, lucide-react→1.17, @graphql-codegen/cli→latest), then storybook needs no pins. This promotes the former "Carryover" phase to the front. Verify: workspace typecheck + base/sdk tests + app (`:5173`) + storybook (`:6006`) all green. THEN advance **§10 1.1 `page/` layout** (the empty-band/weak-header/density fix), screenshot-vs-mockup gated.

## 0. Status ledger

- ✅ **Stage 0 — frontend inventory** (research done; table in §4).
- ✅ **REAL freeze root cause found (NOT Base UI).** The popover/Base-UI theory was
  **wrong**. The freeze is **TanStack Table `autoResetPageIndex`**: ListView passes
  `data: rows` to `useReactTable`, and `rows` (from urql) churns identity across renders, so
  the table auto-resets its page index → `setPagination` → `onStateChange` → setState →
  re-render → new `data` identity → reset again = infinite loop. It hard-locks **WebKit/
  Safari** (deterministic; racy/often-survivable in Chromium). Found via CPU profile call
  tree: top-level trigger task `table.resetPageIndex → setPagination → setState →
  onStateChange`. Needs all of: list view (TanStack Virtual present) + an active group +
  opening the filter popover — the grouped re-render storm keeps the reset loop fed.
- ✅ **FIX (one change):** `autoResetPageIndex: false` + `autoResetExpanded: false` on
  `useReactTable` in `ListView.tsx`. Pagination/sort/filter/group are owned by the
  data-view/URL state, never the table, so auto-reset must be off. Verified in **WebKit**
  (`?group=updatedAt:year|day|year&then=status`, all RESPONSIVE, stable ×3); typecheck +
  26 unit tests green. Repros: `examples/notes-angee/e2e/test-results/{check,repro*}.mjs`.
- ✅ **Follow-up stabilization (owner-level):** `useResourceList` re-derived `rows` via
  `extractPage(run.data)` every render (fresh array even on a urql cache hit) — the churn
  that fed the reset. Memoized on `run.data` identity in `packages/sdk/src/resource-hooks.ts`,
  so every consumer gets a stable `rows`. Workspace typecheck + 113 SDK / 26 base tests green;
  WebKit re-verified RESPONSIVE. Base UI upgrade (Stage 1) **kept** per architect.
- ⚠️ **Earlier false-positive:** my first Playwright pass tested *incrementally adding* a
  group (popover already open) — which dodges the loop — and wrongly concluded Base UI fixed
  it. The deterministic repro is **loading `/notes` with group state in the URL, then
  opening the popover**, and it must be checked in **WebKit**, not Chromium.
- ✅ **Stage 1 — Base UI rename + upgrade** done (`@base-ui-components/react@1.0.0-rc.0` →
  `@base-ui/react@1.5.0`, 14 import sites, 3 ref-type drifts, `PopoverTrigger` rc.0 hack
  deleted, `docs/stack.md` updated; typecheck + 26 tests green). **Independent of the freeze**
  — a legitimate cleanup (off a deprecated dep), but it did **not** fix the freeze.
- ⛔ **Stage 2 — data-view `useTransition`** — **not a free `setTimeout`→`useTransition`
  swap; reverted.** nuqs already owns the deferral (above). Removing the `setTimeout(0)`
  reintroduces the **stale-closure batch drop**: the dispatch builds a *full* query-state
  snapshot via `dataViewReducer`, so two dispatches batched in one commit (the pageSize-sync
  and defaultGroup-seeding effects fire together) each read the same stale `current` and
  clobber each other — the `setTimeout(0)` was serializing them. Belongs to **D-A** (store
  redesign to partial patches), not the freeze fix.
- ⬜ **Stage 3 — build/test toolchain** (vite · @vitejs/plugin-react · vitest · happy-dom · TS).
- ⬜ **Stage 4 — urql data layer** (`@urql/core` + `@urql/exchange-graphcache`).
- ⬜ **Stage 5 — lucide-react** (icon-set major; audit the name-referenced registry).
- ⬜ **Stage 6 — dev types/tooling** (`@types/node`, `@graphql-codegen/cli` patch).
- ⬜ **Backend stack** — separate `uv` inventory pass; **not yet run** (see §8).

## 1. Root cause (why this refactor exists)

When the filter popover is open and you click a toolbar chip that lives in the
`PopoverRoot` subtree but **outside** the portaled popup (the active-filter `FacetChip`
"Remove Draft", `DataToolbar.tsx:207-215`), one trusted native click drives three things
in the same tick:

1. **Base UI dismissal** — outside-press teardown runs **synchronously** (portal unmount,
   positioner cleanup, focus return). `PopoverRoot` is exported raw (`popover.tsx:75`).
2. **The chip's `onClick`** → `onFilterToggle` (`DataToolbar.tsx:300-307`) →
   `dataView.setFilter` (`ListView.tsx:320-324`).
3. That cascades to a query/URL write + a urql reload + virtualizer recompute.

The synchronous teardown reenters mid-commit alongside the heavy reload → renderer lock.
It only shows up on this branch because view-state went **URL/query-backed**, making
filter/group/page clicks heavy and synchronous.

**The DRY smell — three hand-rolled defers, none delegating to the owner:**

- `PopoverTrigger` (`popover.tsx:83-149`): ~65 lines of capture-phase event archaeology —
  swallow the trusted press, `setTimeout(0)`-re-dispatch `trigger.click()`. Reinvents Base
  UI's controlled `open`/`onOpenChange`. Smells like an rc.0 trigger-press bug workaround.
- `data-view-context.tsx:89-125`: every dispatch wrapped in `setTimeout(0)` + a
  `scheduledDispatchesRef` Set + `mountedRef` cleanup. Reinvents `useTransition` +
  nuqs's `startTransition`/`limitUrlUpdates`. `useQueryStates(..., { history })` passes
  **none** of nuqs's perf options.
- **The outside-press path has no defer at all** — the hole the chip falls through.

## 2. Prior art / owners (defer to the stack)

| Concern | Owner in our stack | What we do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Heavy update must not block/tear urgent UI work" | **React 19.2 `useTransition`/`startTransition`** | Mark the view-state→reload update as a transition so React commits the urgent popover teardown first and renders the reload interruptibly. |
| URL/query write timing | **nuqs 2.8.9** (`startTransition`, `limitUrlUpdates: throttle/debounce`, `shallow`) | Pass the transition's `startTransition` + a throttle to `useQueryStates`; nuqs already updates state instantly and rate-limits only the history write. **Contingent on D-A.** |
| Popover dismissal timing | **Base UI** controlled `open`/`onOpenChange(open, eventDetails)` — `reason` (`outside-press`/`trigger-press`/…), native `event`, `cancel()`, `actionsRef` | Upgrade off rc.0; keep `PopoverRoot`/`PopoverTrigger` thin re-exports; delete the bespoke trigger hack. |

Sources: Base UI Popover docs + releases (now **1.2.0**, package renamed
`@base-ui-components/react` → `@base-ui/react`); base-ui #1744 (`onOpenChange` event-detail
change); nuqs options docs ("state is always updated instantly … only URL changes are
throttled/debounced").

## 3. Locked constraints (apply to every stage)

- **Each changed/added dep carries a `docs/stack.md` owner-row update in the same change**
  (repo rule). The Base UI rename row is mandatory in Stage 1.
- **Remove dead code before the structural refactor** — delete the hacks, don't wrap them.
- **Re-read a file before editing and after; verify before claiming done.** Drift is a bug.
- **One stage = one commit** for clean bisect/revert. **Checkpoint the dirty tree first**
  (36 files dirty on `wip-base-lift-refactor`, incl. `@angee/sdk` — upgrading deps on top
  of uncommitted work hurts reversibility).
- **Run from the root.** Stack via `angee dev`; unit via `vitest run`; e2e via Playwright
  (`docs/testing/e2e.md`).
- **Do not contradict `notes-auth-lift.md`.** Resolve **D-A** before wiring nuqs options.

## 4. Stage 0 — Inventory (`pnpm -r outdated`, June 2026)

| Package | Current | Latest | Bump | Stage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@base-ui-components/react` | 1.0.0-rc.0 | **Deprecated** → `@base-ui/react` ≥1.2 | rename + pre-1.0→1.2 | **1** |
| `@urql/core` | 5.2.0 | 6.0.1 | major | 4 |
| `@urql/exchange-graphcache` | 7.2.4 | 9.0.0 | 2 majors | 4 |
| `vite` (dev) | 6.4.2 | 8.0.14 | 2 majors | 3 |
| `@vitejs/plugin-react` (dev) | 4.7.0 | 6.0.2 | 2 majors | 3 |
| `vitest` (dev) | 3.2.4 | 4.1.7 | major | 3 |
| `happy-dom` (dev) | 16.8.1 | 20.9.0 | 4 majors | 3 |
| `typescript` (dev) | 5.9.3 | 6.0.3 | major | 3 |
| `lucide-react` | 0.469.0 | 1.17.0 | major (icon set) | 5 |
| `@types/node` (dev) | 22.19.19 | 25.9.1 | major (types only) | 6 |
| `@graphql-codegen/cli` (dev) | 7.1.0 | 7.1.1 | patch | 6 |

React (`19.2.6`) and nuqs (`2.8.9`) are **current** — the concurrency + URL-state owners we
rely on are already in place; no bump needed for the bug fix.

---

## 5. Staged upgrade plan (dependency-ordered)

### Stage 1 — Base UI rename + upgrade ✅ *(done; freeze fix pending e2e)*
- Renamed `@base-ui-components/react@1.0.0-rc.0` → `@base-ui/react@^1.5.0` (latest 1.5.0)
  in `packages/base/package.json`; rewrote **14 import sites** under `packages/base/src/ui/*`
  + `packages/base/src/lib/slot.ts` (subpaths unchanged).
- Fixed 3 ref-type drifts (1.5 narrowed part ref element types): `SelectContent`→
  `HTMLDivElement`, `TabsTab`→`HTMLElement`, `ToolbarGroup`→`HTMLDivElement`. v1.0 release
  notes confirm the rename is the only breaking change; the rest is non-breaking.
- **Deleted the `PopoverTrigger` rc.0 hack** (`shouldDeferPopoverPress`, `stopPopoverPress`,
  `pendingPointerPressRef`, the `setTimeout` re-dispatch) → `export const PopoverTrigger =
  BasePopover.Trigger`.
- Updated the `docs/stack.md` row to `@base-ui/react`.
- ✅ Workspace typecheck clean; 26 `@angee/base` unit tests green.
- ⬜ **Remaining gate:** e2e/live — confirm (a) the outside-press freeze is gone and (b)
  trigger open/close works by pointer **and** keyboard. Unit tests can't reproduce
  floating-ui teardown.

### Stage 2 — data-view dispatch ⛔ *(reverted; folded into D-A)*
**Finding:** nuqs's react-router adapter already wraps every URL-state update in React
`startTransition` *and* an internal throttle queue, so the heavy reload is already deferred
and de-prioritized — there is nothing for us to add. The `setTimeout(0)` in
`data-view-context.tsx` is **not** a stray defer to delete: it serializes dispatches so the
*full-state-snapshot* updater (`dataViewReducer` over the whole state) doesn't clobber a
sibling dispatch batched in the same commit (pageSize-sync + defaultGroup-seeding effects).
Removing it (whether direct or `useTransition`) reintroduces the **stale-closure batch
drop** — three `DataPage.test.tsx` cases fail (`Remove group`, `Records 1-2 / 4`, `Month`).
- **Proper fix lives in D-A:** redesign the dispatch to emit **partial** query patches
  (per-key), not full snapshots — then batching is safe and the `setTimeout`/`mountedRef`
  bookkeeping drops out for free. Do it with the store decision, not the freeze fix.
- Keep `PopoverRoot`/`PopoverContent` as thin styled re-exports; **no bespoke defer wrapper**
  anywhere (nuqs + Base UI own the timing).

### Stage 3 — build/test toolchain (coupled)
- Bump together (they constrain each other): `vite 6→8`, `@vitejs/plugin-react 4→6`,
  `vitest 3→4`, `happy-dom 16→20`, `typescript 5.9→6`.
- Expect: Vitest 4 config/API shifts; TS 6 surfacing new strictness; happy-dom DOM-API
  deltas affecting `@vitest-environment happy-dom` tests.
- Gate: full `vitest run` across `@angee/base` + `@angee/sdk` green; `tsc` clean; example
  web build (`vite build`) succeeds.

### Stage 4 — urql data layer (coupled, higher risk)
- `@urql/core 5→6` + `@urql/exchange-graphcache 7→9` together. Touches `@angee/sdk`
  (`resource-hooks`, `document-query`, `aggregates`, invalidation wiring) — note these are
  **already dirty** in the working tree; reconcile, don't clobber.
- `docs/stack.md`: confirm the urql rows still describe the wiring accurately.
- Gate: `@angee/sdk` tests green; live reads/subscriptions verified via `angee dev` + e2e.

### Stage 5 — lucide-react `0.469 → 1.17` (icon set)
- Major icon-set bump; names can change/deprecate. Audit the **name-referenced icon
  registry** (`docs/stack.md` lucide row; `Glyph`/icon usage in chrome + toolbars).
- Gate: no missing-icon fallbacks; visual smoke of nav/toolbar/menus.

### Stage 6 — dev types/tooling (low risk)
- `@types/node 22→25`, `@graphql-codegen/cli 7.1.0→7.1.1`.
- Gate: typecheck + codegen (if used) clean.

---

## 6. Verification — the freeze regression

- **Unit (`DataPage.test.tsx` conventions):** open the filter popover, activate a filter,
  then with the popover open click the outside `Remove <label>` chip; assert the filter is
  removed and the popover closes (flush with `nextTask()`, `DataPage.test.tsx:371`). This
  guards behavior but **cannot** reproduce the lock (no real floating-ui in happy-dom).
- **E2E (Playwright, the real gate):** the lock only reproduces with live floating-ui +
  router. Script: open filter popover → click outside "Remove Draft" → assert page stays
  responsive and filter/URL updated. Per `docs/testing/e2e.md`. **This is the gate that
  confirms the Stage 1 upgrade actually fixed the freeze.**

## 7. Sequencing & gates

1. Checkpoint the dirty tree (done — committed) so each upgrade is revertible.
2. **Stage 1 ✅ (the freeze fix)** → run the §6 e2e repro to confirm the lock is gone.
3. Stages 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 (toolchain → urql → icons → dev types), each its own commit,
   each gate green before the next.
4. **D-A** (architect) → the data-view dispatch redesign (former Stage 2): partial
   query patches, which also retires the `setTimeout`/`mountedRef` bookkeeping.
5. Per-stage gate: `tsc` clean · `vitest run` green · example `vite build` ok ·
   relevant e2e subset green against `angee dev` · `docs/stack.md` row updated for any
   dep whose name/ownership changed.

## 8. Open decisions / not-yet-scoped

- **D-A (from `notes-auth-lift.md`):** nuqs vs TanStack Router search as the view-state
  owner. **Now owns the data-view dispatch redesign** (former Stage 2). The `setTimeout(0)`
  is load-bearing because the dispatch emits *full-state snapshots*: confirmed by reverting
  it and watching `Remove group` / `Records 1-2 / 4` / `Month` drop (the M3 P1-review
  "stale-closure batch drop"). Fix = per-key **partial** patches (then the timer bookkeeping
  drops out), decided alongside the store. nuqs already provides `startTransition` + throttle
  internally, so no explicit transition is needed either way.
- **TS 6 / Vite 8 / Vitest 4 compatibility:** verify peer ranges at run time; may need
  lockstep or a held-back pin if an ecosystem plugin lags.
- **Backend stack ("entire stack"):** Python deps (`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`) are **not
  inventoried here.** Needs its own pass (`uv tree --outdated` / `uv lock --upgrade` dry
  run) and its own plan section before touching — Django/Strawberry/zed-rebac majors carry
  migration + SDL-emit risk. Flag to architect: in scope now, or separate?

## 9. Pointers (kept, not duplicated)

- Bug owner: `packages/base/src/ui/popover.tsx` (`PopoverTrigger` now a thin re-export).
- Deferral owner: **nuqs** (react-router adapter: `startTransition` + throttle queue) — not
  our code. `data-view-context.tsx` `setTimeout(0)` only serializes full-snapshot dispatches.
- Toolbar chips (the outside-press source): `packages/base/src/toolbars/DataToolbar.tsx`.
- Adapter wiring: `packages/base/src/createApp.tsx:213` (`NuqsAdapter`).
- Single-source plan + D-A: `.agents/plans/notes-auth-lift.md` (§2).
- Stack ownership table: `docs/stack.md`.

## 10. Execution TODO — UX & P1 design parity (tracked)

Each item carries three boxes:
- **done** — implemented; `tsc` + lint green.
- **verified** — automated check (unit/e2e) **and** a WebKit/live check per the area's
  guideline (the Safari freeze proved Chromium-only checks aren't enough).
- **checked by human (final qa)** — Alexis signs off on the actual UX/visual result.

> **Token / visual-layer copy policy — architect override (2026-06-01).** The repo default
> is *reconstruct, never copy, strip provenance* (`notes-auth-lift.md` §1). For the
> **design tokens and the visual/layout layer only**, copying from P1 verbatim is
> **approved** — there's no value in re-deriving a palette/scale, and parity is the point.
> The binding constraint is **clean decomposition: no monolithic/spaghetti files** — split
> tokens and layout primitives into small, single-purpose pieces that fit this repo's
> structure. Scope is tokens + visual layout; component *logic* still follows
> find-the-owner/DRY. Reconcile this override into `notes-auth-lift.md`. P1 source (read-only):
> `../angee-django-p1`. Detailed file-level surface is in the **P1 UI Inventory** below.

> **Reference model & goal (architect, 2026-06-01).** The goal is an **enhanced, cleaner,
> denser reconstruction — NOT a weak copy.** Two distinct references:
> - **Look & feel → the initial mockup** `../angee-console-mockups/angee-console-react`
>   (runs at `http://localhost:5174/#/notes`). This is the visual target: dense grouped
>   rows with counts, status badges, tag chips, assignee avatars, relative dates, real
>   toolbar + header. Screenshot it for any screen and match-or-beat it.
> - **Features → dissect P1** `../angee-django-p1` (functional behaviour/contracts).
>
> **Every UI slice gets THREE reviews, not two:** `architecture-reviewer` (boundaries/DRY/
> decomposition) + `react-reviewer` (hooks/render/TS) + a **VISUAL review** — screenshot
> ours vs the mockup at the same screen and judge density/polish/layout fidelity (code
> reviewers cannot see pixels; this lens was missing and let a weak look through).
>
> **Root of the weak copy (diagnosed):** P1/the mockup use a real page-layout system —
> `<Page>`→`<PageHeader>`→`PageControlBand`→`<PageBody>`(navigator aside + list). We lifted
> **none** of `page/` (9 files, absent), so our screen is a bare list with a stray empty
> band and no real header/density. The `page/` layout system is the first foundation lift.

### Approach — storybook-first (revised 2026-06-01, architect)
1. Stand up a clean **Storybook** in this repo. 2. Lift **every visual component** into it,
matched to the mockup look&feel — **presentational, no backend**. 3. **Then wire** components
to data/features per P1. Engine: **Codex lifts** each slice; **3 reviews per slice**
(architecture + react + visual-vs-mockup); each item carries done · verified · human QA.
File-level surface = the **P1 UI Inventory** below. Sift the source per slice; reconstruct,
don't copy (tokens/visual-layout exempt per override). Goal: enhanced, cleaner, denser.

## STAGE 1 — All visual components in Storybook (no backend)

### 1.0 Storybook & visual tooling
- [x] done [x] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Stand up a clean Storybook — `packages/storybook/` (Storybook 10 + react-vite, vite 6 / TS 5.7 aligned to workspace); loads tokens via `@angee/base/styles.css`; runs at `:6006`
- [x] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Visual-review harness: Playwright screenshot of a story (`test-results/sb-story.mjs`) + compare to mockup (`:5174`); per-component parity log TBD
- [x] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Story conventions (CSF) established (Button + TopMenu); kitchen-sink overview story TBD
- [x] done [x] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Base icons resolve in Storybook via a preview decorator seeding `baseIcons` into `AppRuntimeProvider` (TopMenu story renders icons)

### 1.1 Foundation — tokens / layout / primitives / fragments
- [x] done [x] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Design tokens at P1 parity (185 vars identical; ours cleaner) — no copy needed
- [x] done [x] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — `page/` layout system (Page/PageHeader/PageToolbar/PageBody/PageAside/PageFooter/SplitPanes/SectionNav) + 10 stories ← fixes empty-band/weak-header. **Full cadence ran clean:** Codex lift → arch+react reviewers → Codex hung on a Storybook browser smoke-check (killed, restarted typecheck-only) → all fixes applied (SectionNav reuses `tabsVariants`; PageToolbar `role=toolbar` + ref cast gone; PageHeader `headingLevel`; SplitPaneHandle inherits group direction via context; PageBody `as` override; aria-current correctness; story units/tokens; `page/` shell naming note) → independently verified: base+storybook typecheck green, `SplitPanes`→react-resizable-panels ✓, zero provenance ✓. **Visual gate caught a broken `ConsoleShell` story** (needs router context the SB decorator lacks) → replaced with a content-region story that renders + documents scroll ownership; full ConsoleShell+Page story deferred to §10 1.2 (needs a router-in-Storybook decorator). All 10 stories render clean (`test-results/page-slice/`). Frame story = dense header + populated control band + dense table + inspector aside + footer pager → matches mockup. Committing.
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — `layouts/` (6) + `ui/form-layout` (FormGrid/FormActions/FormFooter/FieldRow) + grid-area form placement + stories
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — `ui/` primitives parity (~29 missing: accordion, collapsible, drawer/sheet, dropdown-menu, context-menu, toggle, toggle-group/segmented, slider, number-field, calendar, radio-group, command, navigation-menu, selection-bar, avatar/kinded-avatar, status-icon, code, kbd, alert/banner, text-link, nav-link, section-eyebrow, form) + stories
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — `fragments/` (31: RecordHeader, CollectionHeader, InfoRow, MetricStrip, MetaGrid, EmptyState, DirtyPill, …) + stories
- [x] done [x] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Icon system: `Glyph`→runtime addon-icon registry (single owner), vocabulary trimmed, AppRail fallback, menu/nav icons render — committed `4740a6a`. **Stage-1.0 follow-up:** base icons resolve only via createApp seeding → add a static `baseIcons` fallback in `useIcon` (or a base-runtime Storybook decorator) so they render standalone.

### 1.2 Chrome / shell (presentational)
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — AppRail/AppBrand/TopBar/TopMenu(+Rail/+Dropdown)/Breadcrumb/Systray/UserMenu/GlobalSearch/Spotlight/AppChooser + menu-tree + stories
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Shell/ConsoleShell/PublicShell layouts + stories

### 1.3 Data views (presentational, mock data) — match mockup density
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — ListView: dense rows, collapsible grouped rows w/ counts, status badges, tag chips, avatars, column chooser, selection bar, aggregate footer, **column sort cycle (asc→desc→none, aria-sort), row-link nav (click/Enter/modifier), skeleton/empty/error/filtered-empty states, indeterminate select-all** + stories
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — DataToolbar/CollectionDataToolbar: search, removable chips, custom filters, group-by + granularities, favorites, view switcher, Pager (list range + page-size popover; form record-number; prev/next) + stories
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — DataPage/ResourcePage: `Page→Header→ControlBand→Body`(navigator aside + content); record placement inline/drawer + stories
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — FormView + form-layout DSL (Field/Group/Header/Title/StatusBar/SmartButton/Notebook/Tab/Panel/Relation), **unsaved-changes nav guard, inline save-error banner, inline H1 title input (edit)/H1 (read-only), form record-pager + More overflow menu** + stories
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — BoardView/CalendarView/GalleryView/GanttView/TimelineView/TreeView/GraphView/DashboardView + stories

### 1.4 Widgets (presentational triplets edit/read/cell)
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — registry + text/textarea/email/url/phone/integer/float/json/boolean/booleanToggle
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — date/datetime (+internals), selection/combobox, markdown editor+preview (CodeMirror)
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — statusBadge/statusbar/ribbon/tagInput(+`tags`)/progressBar/ownerCell/themePicker/many2one/many2many + stories

### 1.5 Communication / feedback / preview / upload / cells
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Chatter (aside/tabs/composer/counts/RevisionTimeline) + Chat primitives + stories
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — ModalsHost / Toast + stories
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — `preview/`(5) · `upload/`(4) · `cells/`(6) + stories

### 1.6 Addon UI (presentational) — per addon
> **Placement — DECIDED (architect, 2026-06-01):** addon UI lives at
> **`src/<namespace>/<addon>/web/`** — co-located with each addon's backend, exactly like
> the existing notes consumer addon (`examples/notes-angee/src/example/notes/web/`). So the
> lifted framework addons become full-stack units, e.g. `src/angee/auth/web/`,
> `src/angee/storage/web/` (backend Python beside `web/` frontend). Base/framework UI
> primitives stay in `packages/base`; addon UI composes `@angee/base` + `@angee/sdk`.
> Skip empty stubs: connect/integrate/money/sequence/uom.
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — auth UI (login + fragments + views) — ~31 files

- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — knowledge UI (views) — ~4 files

## STAGE 2 — Wire to backend (features per P1)
> Gated by **D-A** (nuqs vs TanStack Router search). Dissect P1 for behaviour/contracts.
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — SDK contracts: data-view state · aggregates/group hooks · model-fields metadata · providers/runtime · persisted ops · feedback queue (reconcile with current SDK)
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Wire list/group/aggregate/pagination + form read+mutate + toolbar filters to data
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Wire widgets to field metadata; `notes.wordCounter` override (live body + backend aggregate)
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Wire each addon to its backend (routes/menus/queries/mutations/roles/i18n)

### Stage 2 acceptance — P1 regressions to preserve (human-QA gates)
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Column visibility editor; last visible column cannot be hidden
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Chained group-by (year→month) with backend bucket counts/totals + forwarded granularity
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Pager: list-mode range `1-50 / N` + page-size popover (10/20/50/80/100/200, default 50) and form-mode record number `N / total`, both with prev/next paging — page position always visible
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Nested/collapsible group rows with stable keys + summaries
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Form save: dirty-only controls, no flash/reload, no revert, baseline resets to saved value
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — New/empty form derivation: single header title/status, no duplicate body/header
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Notes word count (live body widget + backend aggregate totals)
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Markdown editor: commands, toolbar, link input, keybindings, preview
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Visual/layout fidelity vs mockup (density, real header, no empty band, focus/border)

## Carryover — orthogonal dep upgrades (not gating the lift)
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — `vite 6→8` + `@vitejs/plugin-react 4→6` · `vitest 3→4` + `happy-dom 16→20` · `typescript 5.9→6`
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — `@urql/core 5→6` + `@urql/exchange-graphcache 7→9` · `lucide-react 0.469→1.17` · `@types/node 22→25` · `@graphql-codegen/cli`
- [ ] done [ ] verified [ ] checked by human (final qa) — Backend `uv` stack: inventory (`uv tree --outdated`) + scoped upgrade plan

# P1 UI Inventory and Lift Checklist

Status: inventory plan, not implementation.

Reference checkout: `../angee-django-p1`.

Resolved P1 host path: `../angee-django-p1/examples/angee-notes/web`.
The user-provided path `../angee-django-p1/examples/notes/web` is stale in the
P1 checkout available from this workspace.

Target repo: this repository, `/Users/alexis/Work/angee/angee-django`.

## Scope

This checklist tracks every React surface reachable from the P1 notes host app:

- the host entrypoint and host-only demo login slot;
- addon manifests, routes, menus, widgets, chatter tabs, slots, and i18n;
- base framework chrome such as app rail, topbar, breadcrumbs, systray, user
  menu, chatter, page shells, toolbar controls, and modals;
- all view primitives used by notes and the base addons, including list, board,
  form, calendar, gallery, gantt, timeline, tree, graph, dashboard, pagination,
  group-by, filters, favorites, custom filters, aggregators, and bulk actions;
- SDK runtime contracts and providers that make those components work;
- generated runtime metadata/operations consumed by the UI, recorded as
  dependencies only. Generated runtime stays output, not source.

Important interpretation: the import closure includes all exports reachable
through `@angee/base` barrels. Some components are exported and available but
not mounted by the P1 notes host on first load. They are still included because
the lift target is the reusable framework surface, not only the visible notes
screen.

## Owner Map

- Framework-owned UI belongs under `packages/base/src` in this repo.
- Framework-owned headless contracts, routing, persisted operations, GraphQL,
  data-view state, auth, and field metadata belong under `packages/sdk/src`.
- Addon product surfaces belong under their source addon packages, not under the
  host app. P1 has top-level `addons/*/ui/base`; this repo currently does not.
- The notes example addon belongs under the example/addon source, not generated
  `runtime/`.
- Generated operation names and field metadata are dependencies to regenerate
  from source contracts, not files to edit by hand.

## Import Closure Snapshot

- Entrypoint: `../angee-django-p1/examples/angee-notes/web/src/main.tsx`.
- Internal source files reached: 462.
- Breakdown:
  - `packages/base`: 270 files.
  - `packages/sdk`: 19 files.
  - `packages/base-previews`: 13 files.
  - `addons/agents`: 20 files.
  - `addons/angee`: 14 files.
  - `addons/auth`: 31 files.
  - `addons/integrate-auth-oauth`: 18 files.
  - `addons/knowledge`: 3 files.
  - `addons/operator`: 30 files.
  - `addons/storage`: 29 files.
  - notes example addon: 11 files.
  - host web: 2 files.
  - generated runtime metadata/operations: 2 files.

Current-repo gap observed during inventory:

- No top-level `addons/` directory exists in this repo.
- No `packages/base-previews` package exists in this repo.
- `packages/base/src` is much smaller than P1 and misses the majority of the
  chrome, toolbar, view, widget, feedback, preview, upload, and fragment
  surface.
- `packages/sdk/src` exists but differs materially from P1 and lacks the P1
  data-view, persisted operation, runtime provider, auth provider, route, field
  metadata, feedback, permission, CSRF, and storybook contracts listed below.

## Known P1 Fixes and Regressions To Preserve

These are explicit preservation checks from P1 git history plus current visual
regressions observed in this repo. Treat them as acceptance criteria for the
lift, not optional polish.

| Done | P1 history signal | Surface | Preservation check |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [ ] | `74f4c6b80 ListView: column editor in the table header (page mode), not a separate bar`; `aef72e899 checkpoint: add list sorting and column controls` | Column selector | List/table views must expose the column visibility editor from the table header/page mode. The user must be able to choose visible columns, and the last visible column cannot be hidden. |
| [ ] | `7b31cf12d sdk: backend aggregation consumption`; `e68d319bf base: declarative <Column aggregate>`; `84e087933 base: ResourcePage feeds backend group buckets`; `69bdd753d frontend: address review — forward search/granularity, wire footer total` | Aggregates and group chains | Data views must support chained grouping, e.g. aggregate by year and then within that by month, with backend bucket counts/totals and selected date granularities forwarded through the query. |
| [ ] | `45b9fa0da fix notes server-side grouping integration`; `5e4d89d8b feat(DataView): grouped rows with collapsible carets + per-group summary` | Nested group rows | Group rows must be nested/collapsible with stable keys, summaries, and aggregate values, not a single flat group. |
| [ ] | `b53a8fb63 Extract base pagination primitive`; P1 `packages/base/src/ui/pagination.tsx` + `views/data-view-model.ts` | Pager / page number | The pager has **two modes**, both showing position (not just a flat record range): **list** mode shows the record range `1-50 / N` with a **page-size popover** (options 10/20/50/80/100/200, default 50) and prev/next; **form** mode shows the record number `N / total` with prev/next to page through records. The current page / record position must always be visible. |
| [ ] | `890a05111 Fix form save regression: send {id, input} with writable fields only`; `45c492557 page reload fix for saving`; `0d636d65c checkpoint commit - notes saving` | Form save behavior | Save and Discard controls appear only when the form is dirty. Saving must not flash/reload the form, must not revert to the initial value, and must reset the dirty baseline to the saved value. |
| [ ] | `83b7bae67 Notes views: restore NoteListView/NoteFormView; fix empty-form derivation`; `db161b717 Notes form: editable title, single status, audit fields, plain word count` | Form derivation | New/empty record forms must derive their editable field state correctly and render a single header status/title, not duplicate body/header fields. |
| [ ] | `8c1ec64b1 Add readonly widget chrome and note word counter`; `98cd86aef notes form fields: drop bogus owner, bind word-count to real field`; `62478b4c5 notes: render backend word-count aggregate, drop client reduce` | Notes word count | Notes must override the word-count field with widget id `notes.wordCounter`. The form widget must read the live markdown body through `useFormState`, while list/group totals must use backend aggregate data. |
| [ ] | `f4c39fb66 Lift markdown CodeMirror commands`; `d01ede91c Implement plan 010 markdown baseline` | Markdown editor | Markdown editor must keep CodeMirror command wiring, toolbar buttons, link input, keybindings, and preview behavior. |
| [ ] | `30bff7deb Fix notes dataview layout controls`; `5627390e1 feat(ui): deferred A.2-A.4 upgrades + visual fixes`; `fc598eb92 refactor(base): land the react reviewer findings (27 items)` | Visual/layout fidelity | The lifted UI must preserve the P1 layout pass. Current observed regression: the Body label/markdown editor area is broken, with duplicate Body text, cramped toolbar chrome, and focus/border layout that does not match the refined P1 form controls. |
| [ ] | `dbd0fbcd7 fix(scenes): grid-area placement + FormView toolbar shape`; `4afbe9c1d Add page layout primitives`; `bc531269e Add base form layout fragments` | Page/form layout | Form chrome, toolbar placement, field groups, page sections, and grid-area placement must match the P1 component layout, not ad hoc local page structure. |
| [ ] | P1 `views/ListView.tsx:890-934` (`ColumnHeader`/`nextDirection`) | Column sort cycle | Sortable column headers cycle asc → desc → none on click, sort exactly one column at a time, and expose `aria-sort` + a direction caret. |
| [ ] | P1 `views/ListView.tsx:1254-1333` (`DataRow` linkProps) | Row-link navigation | Rows with a record route are keyboard-focusable links: click/Enter navigates, modifier/middle click opens a new tab, and clicks on in-cell controls (checkbox/button/link) do not navigate. |
| [ ] | P1 `views/ListView.tsx:675-683,803-818,936-1023` | List loading/empty/error states | List views render four distinct states — initial skeleton (table- and group-shaped), empty-state slot, error slot, and a filtered-empty ("No rows match") vs never-had-rows ("No rows yet") body message — never a blank table. |
| [ ] | P1 `views/ListView.tsx:640-645` (`displayTotal`) | Filtered total count | The toolbar/pager total reflects the *filtered* result count in client mode (search/filter active → filtered count) and the backend total in server mode. |
| [ ] | P1 `views/ListView.tsx:684-722` + `views/data-view-model.ts:63-106` | Selection scope reset | An active row selection clears when the result scope changes (search/filter/custom-filter/group/sort/page/page-size) so bulk actions never run on a stale selection. |
| [ ] | P1 `views/ListView.tsx:769-775` | Select-all indeterminate | The header select-all checkbox renders indeterminate when a subset of page rows is selected and toggles the whole page on click. |
| [ ] | P1 `toolbars/DataToolbar.tsx:527-616,790-824` (`CustomFilterEditor`) | Custom-filter type adaptation | The custom-filter editor derives operator choices and the value control from the selected field's type (text/number/date/selection/relation/boolean) and omits the value input for `isEmpty`/`isNotEmpty`. |
| [ ] | P1 `views/FormView.tsx:420-431,661-677` (`FormUnsavedChangesGuard`) | Unsaved-changes guard | Navigating away from a dirty form prompts an unsaved-changes confirm (Stay/Leave) via the routing navigation blocker; a clean or read-only form does not block. |
| [ ] | P1 `views/FormView.tsx:322,350-355,459-463` (`saveError`) | Save-error banner | A save failure shows an inline error banner above the form (the mutation error message) that clears on the next save or record change. |
| [ ] | P1 `views/FormView.tsx:474-536,564-578` | Inline title / statusbar placement | The title renders as an inline borderless H1 input (edit) / H1 (read-only) in the header; statusbar-semantic fields render only top-right; a body `<Field>` referencing the title or a statusbar field is suppressed (extends the "Form derivation" gate). |
| [ ] | P1 `views/FormView.tsx:737-887` (`FormViewToolbar`/`MoreMenu`) | Form record nav + overflow | The form toolbar shows record position "N of total" with prev/next record paging and an overflow ("More") menu for secondary/danger actions. |
| [ ] | mockup `molecules/Statusbar.tsx:54-85` | Statusbar stage widget | The statusbar/ribbon stage widget renders clickable todo/done/active chevron steps (role tablist/tab) that set the record's stage on click — not a static badge. |
| [ ] | mockup `molecules/ThemePick.tsx:41-73` | Theme picker behavior | The theme picker offers Light/Dark/System swatches that immediately toggle `data-theme` and persist the choice; System shows a split preview. |
| [ ] | mockup `molecules/SmartButtons.tsx:15-58` | SmartButtons | Detail pages can show a SmartButtons row of related-record count shortcuts that navigate to the matching collection/tab on click. |
| [ ] | mockup `molecules/PageTabs.tsx`, `Notebook.tsx` | Page tabs vs notebook | Page-level tabs (per-tab counts, doubling as the section divider) and in-card Notebook tabs are preserved as two distinct tab strips, each switching its panel on click. |

## Top-Level Completion Checklist

- [ ] Re-run the import closure from `examples/angee-notes/web/src/main.tsx`
      before implementation and confirm no P1 source file is missing from this
      inventory.
- [ ] Decide the target package layout for top-level P1 addon UI packages in
      this repo before moving code.
- [ ] Lift SDK contracts first, because base views and addon pages depend on
      them.
- [ ] Lift `packages/base` primitives before higher-level shell/view code.
- [ ] Lift shell/chrome before addon route pages that assume menus, slots,
      chatter, page meta, role gates, and app routing.
- [ ] Lift data-view state, toolbar, ListView, FormView, and DataPage together;
      they are a coupled surface.
- [ ] Lift widget registry and all field widgets before addon forms/lists.
- [ ] Lift base addon manifests and pages only after the reusable framework
      surface compiles.
- [ ] Recreate the notes example addon source rather than editing generated
      runtime.
- [ ] Regenerate runtime operations/field metadata from source contracts after
      lift.
- [ ] Audit the P1 git history above before implementing each affected surface;
      do not reintroduce regressions that P1 already fixed.
- [ ] Verify all route paths, menu ids, widget ids, slot ids, chatter ids, and
      persisted operation names match P1 exactly or are intentionally renamed in
      one owner.
- [ ] Confirm every file in the SDK and base appendices is either lifted,
      intentionally deleted with an owner-level rationale, or replaced by a
      clearly equivalent owner in this repo.

## Cross-Cutting Details That Must Not Be Missed

- [ ] App route names and paths: `/notes`, `/notes/$id`, `/notes/new`,
      `/login`, `/sso/callback`, `/auth/*`, `/storage/*`, `/agents/*`,
      `/angee/*`, `/knowledge/*`, `/operator/*`, `/integrate/*`.
- [ ] Menu anchors: `rail`, `user`, `systray`, and addon parent ids such as
      `notes`, `auth`, `storage`, `agents`, `angee`, `knowledge`, `operator`,
      and `integrate`.
- [ ] Menu display modes: `tabs`, `dropdown`, and `rail`.
- [ ] Menu placement: `start`, `center`, `end`; Auth/Operator are end-placed in
      P1.
- [ ] Role gates: route/menu roles must preserve any-of semantics and
      unauthorized in-shell empty state.
- [ ] Login redirect: anonymous console routes redirect to `/login?next=...`;
      login must validate safe next paths.
- [ ] Login slots: `AUTH_LOGIN_SLOT`, method region for OAuth, card footer
      region for demo credentials.
- [ ] Chatter tabs: default `angee`, `comments`, `activity`; notes overrides
      `activity`; agents overrides/contributes always-scoped AI tab.
- [ ] Chatter live counts: hidden `countSource` components must mount even when
      another chatter tab is active.
- [ ] Chatter width persistence: `angee.chatter-width`.
- [ ] Data-view favorite persistence: `angee:data-view:<resource>:favorites`.
- [ ] Default page size: 50.
- [ ] Page size selector: preserved in `ui/pagination.tsx` and
      `DataToolbar.Pagination`.
- [ ] Column selector: visible from the table header/page ListView chrome; not
      hidden in a separate or unreachable toolbar.
- [ ] Filter popover columns: Filters, Group by, Favorites.
- [ ] Custom filter operators: equality, contains, comparisons, empty checks,
      `in`, `notIn`, and type-specific value editors.
- [ ] Date group granularities: day, week, month, quarter, year.
- [ ] View switcher kinds: table/list/cards/grid/board/kanban/form/detail/
      calendar/pivot/graph where supported by the base control.
- [ ] Group stack, group ordering, group collapse state, and backend aggregate
      buckets must survive the lift.
- [ ] Aggregate chain example: the UI can group/aggregate by year and then add
      month under that year without flattening or replacing the first grouping.
- [ ] Backend aggregates: `Column aggregate="sum"` for notes wordCount must use
      backend aggregate data over the full filtered/grouped set, not page-local
      rows.
- [ ] Bulk actions: selected-row archive/delete with count-sensitive confirms
      and toasts.
- [ ] Record actions: New note, Archive, Share, Delete with primary/more
      surfaces and pending/disabled states.
- [ ] Row navigation: table rows support keyboard activation and modifier-click
      link behavior.
- [ ] Column visibility chooser: cannot hide the last column.
- [ ] Selection scope reset: selection clears when filter/sort/page/group scope
      changes.
- [ ] Form dirty guard: unsaved form navigation blocker must use confirm modal.
- [ ] Save/Discard visibility: Save and Discard appear only when the form is
      dirty; they do not occupy primary chrome on a clean form.
- [ ] Save stability: saving does not flash, reload, revert to the initial
      value, or clobber user-visible state with stale fetch data.
- [ ] Form create navigation: new record save navigates to the saved record id.
- [ ] Header fields: title/statusbar render in form header and are not repeated
      in the body.
- [ ] Full-width form widgets: textarea, markdown, tag input, and any other
      widgets marked full-width by form layout helpers.
- [ ] Markdown editor toolbar: bold, italic, inline code, bullet list, numbered
      list, quote, link popover, and keybindings.
- [ ] Markdown editor layout: no duplicate field label inside the editor body,
      no cramped toolbar overlap, and no broken focus/border treatment like the
      current Body screenshot regression.
- [ ] Notes word-count override: notes form field uses `widget="notes.wordCounter"`
      so the displayed count follows the live body field through `useFormState`.
- [ ] Status choices and tones: derive from generated field metadata where
      available.
- [ ] Relation widgets: preserve `many2one` and `many2many` widget ids and
      combobox behavior.
- [ ] Upload queue: preserve provider, dropzone, task states, tray, and storage
      widget integration.
- [ ] Preview registry: storage must configure and register default preview
      renderers before file previews mount.
- [ ] App rail reorder: pointer and keyboard DnD, persisted order hook, badges,
      tooltips, and default-app long press.
- [ ] Systray and user menu: addon-contributed menu rows plus notifications,
      help, identity header, shortcuts, and sign-out.
- [ ] Toast event bridge: if the `events` operation exists, toasts subscribe to
      backend events; otherwise local toasts still work.
- [ ] Generated runtime: do not hand-edit `runtime/__generated__`; regenerate
      after source changes.
